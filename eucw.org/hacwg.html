<P>

The Hungarian Telegraphy Group  HACWG was founded on July 28, 1985 in
Szekszard with the intention to unite the  Hungarian  amateurs  who
like CW.

The objectives of the group are:
<PRE>
  - to spread and encourage CW
  - to promote and work Hungarian awards
  - to develop the CW skills of its members
</PRE>
Foreign radioamateurs can become honorary members under the  following
conditions: Get two recommendations from HACWG members. Asking for
a recommendation is possible after having a contact for at least 30
minutes at a CW speed of at least 150 letters/minute (PARIS
base). Honorary members are allowed to give out recommendations, too.
Applicants have to include a statement that they did not use
any decoder or computer during the recommendation QSOs.
<P>
Our meetings on air are every Monday around 20 local time (in HA) on 3565
KHz +/- QRM.  The two recommendation QSLs and 5 IRCs  / on entrance only /
should be send together with the application to the following address:
