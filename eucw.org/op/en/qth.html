<h1 id="qth">QTH</h1>
<p>In U.S. locations, normally both the city name and the state abbreviation are given e.g. TAMPA, FL the comma as Morse sign (--..--) is given. However, in normal qso text commas are simply omitted, full stops are omitted, too, or occasionally replaced by a break signal (-...-)</p>
<p>The correct meaning of 'qth' is 'my location is ...'. This implies that we <em>should</em> not use something like 'MY QTH IS PARIS'. However, most do it anyway, and some (beginners) do even like the 'is' (.. ...) as a kind of marker telling them to listen carefully.</p>
<p>The same is with 'OP JOHN' versus 'MY NAME IS JOHN', both versions are heard on the air, and opinions about it differ considerably.</p>
