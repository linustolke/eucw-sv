EuCW Bulletin No 2022/04 (October 7th, 2022)


1) EuCW has as previously been informed a new Chairman.  RM2D (SM6LRR)
Mats is representing U-QRQ-C as Chairman for the next three years. If you
would like to contact Mats, please send him an email to: sm6lrr@gmail.com
We would needless to say, also like to thank IZ2FME, Miki, for his good
efforts as Chairman during the past period.

2) ICWC (International CW Council) was founded with EUCW as one of the
initial founders. Today ICWC consists of 32 member associations with
a total of 95000 CW operators around the world. The council actively
supports many activities that promote active usage of CW. Just to mention
a few:

Creation of a webpage with all associations included (with logos) and
the online calender https://internationalcwcouncil.org/cw-events-calendar/

Support the effort to make CW part of the UNESCO Cultural Heritage program

TOP9 Activity with focus on making minimum five minutes QSOs in the top 9
kHz of each CW band to show overall activity and protect the CW-sections
form digital encroachment

MST (Medium Speed Contest) was established at three separate times weekly
on Mondays and Tuesdays to give more opportunities to operators in the
20-25 WPM speed range and to populate the CW bands on those days.


3) AGCW reminds about the following activities in Q4 (and for 2022 as
a whole):

https://www.agcw.de/contest/sta/ 90 minutes Bug-Contest on Oct 19.

URLs are in German but all activities are open to all. If translation
is needed, please contact Mats SM6LRR, who will ask relevant documents
in English from AGCW.

4) OK QRP Club, http://okqrp.fud.cz/ organize every year in February a
short QRP contest on 80 meters with 5W and 1W categories. The contest
is open to all amateurs. A DXCC ladder up to 5W is published on the
homepage. Yearly participation with a booth during the international
Ham Radio meeting in Holice. Also close cooperation with HAMIK (Little
Ham) that focuses on children and young operators. HAMIK Corner contains
various articles such as small CW transmitters & receivers, CW keys and
paddles, methods for learning CW (suitable for younger as well as older
perople). The book HAMIK MAX can be ordered at info@hwkitchen.cz

6) EuCW history.  You can find the EuCW history at:
https://www.eucw.org/eucwh.html.

7) The associated club LICW (Long Island CW Club) is based in the
USA. They teach Morse Code and related Ham Radio topics through Zoom
with 75 classes weekly. The membership count now exceeds 3100 members
in 50 states and 47 countries (many of our members are also members of
the club. They would like to expand the activities to Europe and also
give classes at suitable times for our time zones. More information can
be found on the website: longislandcwclub.org

8) EuCW Bulletins.  Everyone can download the EuCW bulletins at:
https://www.eucw.org/qtc.html.

9) The new sunspot cycle looks promissing. With increased SFI and
sunspot numbers, even 10 and 12 meter bands have lately started to
become alive. The first real openings to North America as well as
the Pacific have become possible. Last time was probably in 2014
when we could consider stable transatlatic propagation on 12/10
meters. Please make use of these openings and remember to also
spread the activity to the upper 9 kHz of the CW bands. That means
24.906-24.915 kHz on 12 meters and 28.061-28.070 on ten meters. Do not
forget to log those QSOs and submit them for our own program Snakes
and Ladders (rules:  https://eucw.org/sl3.html ) and to TOP9 (rules:
https://internationalcwcouncil.org/top9-activity/ )

Best regards and 73!

RM2D (SM6LRR) Mats
EuCW Chairman
