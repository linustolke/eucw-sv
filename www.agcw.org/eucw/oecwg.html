<B>OE-CW-Gemeinschaft,</B>

<!/A> 
Austrian Club for CW enthusiasts.

<P>
First Austrian Telegraphy Interest Group,
<P>
would like to introduce itself
<P>
Morse telegraphy is the oldest and most traditional form of long
distance communication but regrettably the era of CW has come to an end in
the field of commercial as well as Naval radio services. 
<P>
If thousands of radio amateurs all over the world still make use of
their key, it is not due to nostalgic enthusiasm alone but because
telegraphy, as is universally acknowledged, enables global communication
by use of simple means even under unfavorable conditions.
<P>
To  provide a homestead for all radio amateurs who are willing to make
use of their key at least once in a while or - even better -  to give
preference to telegraphic communication in general, the Radio Society of
Austria - ÖVSV - has decided to create a specific section for telegraphy
within the society 
under my auspices from May 24th 1997, whereby interested persons from
Austria as well as abroad may subscribe into the OE-CW-G, an interest
group for radio telegraphy whose objectives are to promote the
improvement of telegraphy techniques and encourage the use of CW thereby
attempting to establish contacts and create friendship between radio
amateurs all over the world.
<P>
To all who want to join our club, the simple application procedure is as
follows:
<P>
1. Please send informal application for membership in the OE-CW-G
<P>
2. To encourage the use of CW on the bands add copies of 20 QSL cards
confirming contacts in telegraphy
<P>
3. One valid contact (QSO) on one of the sked evenings
<P>
4. To cover printing and mailing costs please add 8 IRCs or appropriate
value in foreign currency (membership is lifelong, no further charges
are collected)
<P>
