EuCW Bulletin No 2021/03
========================

ICWC - International CW Council request

Howard - WB2UZE (from the ICWC) informs us about the status of the ICWC 1st Initiative, the 'Giving Back Program':
So far only 3 clubs have contributed to this program:

a) Long Island CW Club has given 10 operators;
b) FISTS UK 1 operator;
c) LIDS UK 1 operator;

This is should be a very easy thing to do: the ICWC are asking
each member club to give 5 operators.

Please support this program so we can accomplish one easy goal.
Please read the below March 2 email and contact Rob K6RB with
your volunteers. We are only asking 1 hour per week from a
volunteer and that involves making QSOs with anyone on 40/80m
between 15-20wpm. Many thanks in advance and best 73, stay
safe. De IZ2FME EuCW Chairman.

> Subject: [IntlCWCouncil] Something we can do right away...
> One year ago, the CWops group launched a program called "Giving
> Back" where volunteers pick a day or more per week and get on 40
> (or 80) meters at their 7 PM local time. With speed set at 20
> wpm or less, they solicit regular QSOs providing by example the
> proper ways to solicit, respond and engage in QSOs while offering
> those they work potentially a lot of QSO practice time. This
> program could be expanded to include all CW organizations so
> that volunteers are using straight keys, bugs and keyers while
> keeping to the modest speed and QSO format. Right now there is
> a Giving Back schedule that is kept updated monthly on the CWops
> website (https://cwops.org/giving-back/). Currently it accounts
> for up to 27 hours of weekly practice potential. Each month the
> callsigns of those worked are submitted and tabulated to give
> monthly views of operational results. These are also posted to the
> CWops website. An expanded program could be managed and hosted
> on a future IntlCWCouncil website. In addition to the number of
> volunteers, the schedule can be expanded to include 24 hours daily
> so that there is coverage in Oceania and Asia as well as NA and
> EU. Unlike the CWops' CW Academy, the Giving Back program has no
> rigid structure. We call CQ and make QSOs. Therefore, it lends
> itself well to an IntlCWCouncil joint-effort program. Originally,
> we chose 7 PM local times so that people with modest stations
> would be able to make QSOs with people in the same or adjacent
> time zones on 40 meters. We found that some of the European
> volunteers were having trouble with 40 and wanted to try using
> 80, instead. That appeared to work for them. Rather than having a
> floating schedule, we opted to have the times fixed and schedules
> posted so that people who might want to take advantage of it know
> exactly when to look, and who to look for. As we all know, the
> best of tools for learning CW must be augmented with practical,
> hands-on experience. I believe this program may be a way to
> immediately promote the Council and demonstrate its inter-group,
> cooperative nature. Right now, it is a suggestion. Let me know
> what you think. Thanks. 73 Rob K6RB

I wish you all the best and stay safe!
