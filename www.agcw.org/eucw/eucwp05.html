<h1>25th EUCW Fraternizing CW QSO Party 2005<br>
Results</h1>
</center>
<p>
Guenther, DJ2XP, has resigned as Fraternizing CW QSO Party manager,
unfortunately, health problems have interfered with the succession
procedure and not all documents could be recovered. It seems
that the results of the 2005 Fraternizing CW QSO Party may have got lost.
Hopefully, the lost documents can be found in the new future. Apologies
to all.
<P>
EUCW is indebted to Guenther for the great work he has done as manager
of both FP and the EUCW award. Moreover, he performed a job in the AGCW.
Thanks Guenther.
