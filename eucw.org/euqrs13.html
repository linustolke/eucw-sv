Excerpts from the soap box:

SV0XBN/9: I am sorry that I was limited to 20m only and
could only spend a short time on the band. It was good to
work some new operators.

G4LHI: I really do enjoy this event &amp; being able to work on
as many bands as possible, especially with the local guys,
it&acute;s very good practice &amp; also ensures that the different
antennae work properly now &amp; again, it certainly makes a
nice change from the usual bands we work on.  It is also
nice to be able to have good old fashioned rag chews &amp;
catch up with old &amp; new friends. I must say, I am afraid,
the event did not seem to be as well populated as other
years.

G0ILN: ... which I thoroughly enjoyed.

DJ6UX: Ohne SOCWA haette das dieses Jahr aber traurig
ausgesehen.  Besonders enttaeuschend ist die praktisch
nicht vorhandene Unterstuetzung durch AGCW-Mitglieder. Oder
meiden die einfach nur das Hotband?

DL2FCA: Leider sind es nur 32 QSOs geworden, dennoch bin
ich froh, dass ich &uuml;berhaupt dabei sein konnte...

2E0DPH: I found activity quite limited, perhaps it was the
fact that I only had limited time when I was able to take
part, I hope you have still  had good support for the EuCW
QRS activity week.

OE6GWG: Leider konnte ich heuer nicht an der EuCW
Fraternizing CW Party teilnehmen da zu dieser Zeit in Laa
an der Thaya eine Funkausstellung stattfand und ich am
Stand der OECWG Werbung f&uuml;r die Betriebsart CW machte.

IK2RMZ: Believe it or not, this was the most successful
QRSW ever, at least the number of incoming logs reached
a record high. However, this is not a measure for success.
The highlight for me was that one of the participants
told me it was his very first CW qso in a life time.

Another element which matters is how many QRS stations are
actually heard during the QRSW.
A nice tool to measure this is the Reverse Beacon Network. It is
a network of receivers scanning the CW bands for CQ calls.

Congratulations to the holders of high RBN counts, these op did 
really call CQ patiently.
