<h1 id="prosigns">Prosigns</h1>
<p>are special Morse code characters which are commonly used.
<em>NOTE</em> that two letter pro signs are given as two Morse code
letters without a space in between.</p>
<ul>
<li>KN -.--. passes the transmitting over to a single station</li>
<li>K -.- passes the transmitting over</li>
<li>C -.-. correct, affirmative</li>
<li>CL -.-. .-.. closing down (with space). The station does not intend to
keep on using the frequency.</li>
<li>N -. no, negative</li>
<li>BK -...-.- <a href="bk.html">break in</a></li>
<li>BT -...- break point (=), do not confuse with -....- hyphen</li>
<li>CT -.-.- commence traffic, starting to transmit, or start of a
message. ct is not used very often.</li>
<li>AR .-.-. end of message, this prosign is superfluous in informal CW
traffic. In networks that exchange formal telegrams (qtc) the ar prosign
ends a qtc. ar is still used in such qtc nets but also outside them.
Different op have different opinions about it and use it differently.</li>
<li>SK ...-.- transmission finished. No reply expected. This ends a qso.
The station may change frequency or may restart calling cq on this
frequency.</li>
<li>VE ...-. understood, correctly received, German:
<em>ve</em>rstanden</li>
<li>R .-. roger/received (occasionally r is transmit with an extra pause
(. -.) after the first dot.</li>
<li>AS .-... wait (<em>a</em> <em>s</em>econd)</li>
<li>error ........ 8 dots is the prosign for errors. The correct use is to
put the error sign after an error and to repeat the last correct word.
This practice is rarely observed in ham radio, usually an incorrect word
is corrected by transmitting the correct word afterwards plus one or two
repetitions of the correct word. At times the error prosign is replaced by
a short sequence of dots with spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these prosign Morse chars are used in qso practice, the 'n' is
less common and often replaced by a plain 'no'. The 'r' is often used as a
habit an does not necessarily mean that your qso partner has understood
the entire message (though it <em>should</em> mean exactly this).</p>
<h2 id="obs">Obs</h2>
<p>Those using electronic code generators with a keyboard interface are
advised to check that the correct code is always transmitted. Most code
generators can create prosigns but they are using particular keyboard
sequences.</p>
