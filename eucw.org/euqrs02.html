RESULTS OF THE 2002 EuCW/FISTS QRS PARTY

<P>
Once again an interesting set of logs has been received although not
as many as I had hoped for. What was apparent from the logs was that
most people enjoyed the event again and it was nice to see some new
callsigns.
<P>
This year our eldest entrant went one better than last year and won
the event, many congratulations Dick, G8NT. The score Dick achieved
was nearly 11,000 higher than last year's winner and more than double
his last years score. It goes to prove that with some effort QSO's can
be found and good scores assembled.
<P>
Congratulations to all the certificate winners and especially G0EML,
Ray, for winning the "Most Readable Morse Heard" during the event. It
was interesting to note that, like last year's winner of this title,
this was Ray's first contest.

<P>
It should be noted that DL1BUG was operating as a multiplier this
year, hence the four clubs used, as he didn't have very much time. He
changed his club after every QSO.

As I am giving up the FISTS Contest Managers position I am not sure
what will happen to this contest next year.
