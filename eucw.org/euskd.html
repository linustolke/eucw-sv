<h3>Concept</h3>
The SKD is no contest. The goal is to give hams a pleasant opportunity
<br>to work CW-QSOs at a convenient speed using a hand key.
<br>The competition is <i>to work the most beautiful CW ever heard</i>.
<h3>Date</h3>
EuCW SKD takes place yearly on the Swedish Midsummer Day, i.e.
the Saturday falling on or between the dates June 20 and
June 26. 
<h3>Time</h3>
0800  2200 UTC
<h3>Frequency bands in KHz</h3>
3540-3580
<br>7020-7040
<br>10105-10125
<br>14050-14070
<br>The competitors are asked to work in the 10 and 14 MHz bands
<br>to give our non-scandinavian friends and colleagues better
opportunities
<br>to QSO us in Scandinavia.
<h3>Mode</h3>
Only CW using a <b>hand key</b>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
The number of QSOs must be five or more.
<br>In every QSO, the fist of your counter operator shall be graded 0 - 5
<br>Avoid &quot;fellow voting&quot;. It's only the fist that counts.
<p>The final score will be counted by the SKD manager in the following
manner.
<br>The sum of all QSO-grades will be divided by the number
<br>of grades received. Thus the maximum score is 5.0
<h3>Awards</h3>
<b>SKD Straight Key Award</b>
<br>will be awarded to those who are given the score 3.5 as the lowest.
<br><b>The SCAG Golden Key</b>
<br>will be awarded the operator given the highest grade
<br>in the New Year's Day SKD. If more operators has grade 5.0,
<br>the highest number of given grades will qualify.
<h3>Logs</h3>

<br>The log excerpts shall contain at least:
