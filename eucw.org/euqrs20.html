Comments:

most participants reported that they enjoyed the event.
Some claimed they experienced poor condx. This is true in the
sense that we are in the sunspot minimum. Yet, factually the
conditions were regular. From my point of view in the southern
pre-Alps I felt rather lucky than unlucky because the QRN stayed
moderate, unfortunately I did not encounter sporadic E condx.

One participant mentioned the low number of those who called CQ
QRS - this is true but using such a cq call is not mandatory, I
would not even recommend it because it might trigger the rule that
it is generally unwise to answer a CQ XYZ call unless you know for
sure what XYZ means.

Someone else encountered a station with decent CW produced by a
mouthpiece and an air flow sensor.

My highlight was a contact with a Belgian newcomer who declared
to be on his very first CW QSO. I had several other QSOs with
stations who were brand new to CW. Not all of these stations
sent in a log, but they are the main players. 

Thanks to all es 73
