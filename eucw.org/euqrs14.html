Errors are calculated like this: a missing,
wrong, misspelled qth, name, or rst counts 0.2
points. A wrong call counts 0.4 points. This
is purely informative because a fair comparison
is not possible. Some if not most use 3rd party
data sources to retrieve qths and names. Some log
directly into a PC, others copy manually. Some
are good spellers, others show dyslexic
tendencies in their logs.

Do not misread this. A high average does not mean
that the QRSW qsos were performed at excessive
speed. It may also mean that some dedicated
only part of their activity to the QRS week.

However, it is true that it is quite difficult
to maintain the QRS speed. The main reason for
this is fatigue and inertia. It is so easy to
fall back to usual operating speeds, especially
when using manual keys.


Random selection of comments from participants

Dean: Thank you for the QRS week activity.
I have never had a real CW QSO before this week
so only a few contacts this year but enjoyed
it greatly just wish there had been more ops
on when and where I was listening.  Now back to
practice to increase my speed!

Mervyn: A Great QRS Week, had great fun working
some very good slow CW Op's, It is nice to
slow your Fist CW down once in a while to help
others and improve your own CW... Thank you for
the Event.

Richard: Had a great time and discovered the QRS
frequencies that I had not paid any attention
to before.

Peter: I enjoyed this event as usual, but was
very disappointed with the lack of activity
from some Fists Members & other EUCW Clubs that
were always so active on this event in past
years. It must be very disappointing for those
who organize this & other CW events, that there
seems to be a lack of interest. WHY?
