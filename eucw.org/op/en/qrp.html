<h1 id="qrp-vs-qro">QRP vs QRO</h1>
<p>Without any doubt CW has key potentials for successful operation at any
power level and it is worthwhile to give a few ideas about operating
techniques. The major subject of this text is how to behave when QRO
operators and QRP operators meet on air. It may be interesting to describe
the different view points.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>The most common power used in CW is probably 100 W or slightly less.
Occasionally, this is called "barefoot". Many call this QRO operation,
disregarding the fact there are plenty of stations who can use power
levels of 1 kW or more. However, even most owners of powerful amplifiers
work barefoot most of the time and save their energy (and trouble with
neighbors) for pile-ups. The common terms are that RF output up to 1W is
called QRPP while QRP is 5 W output power or less. This definition is
widely defended by most QRP clubs, however, there is a lot of ham radio
equipment that can deliver 10W output. Users of such equipment they claim
to be <em>QRP</em>, too. In contesting the categories are different: QRP
is 5W or less, LP ("Low" power) is up to 100W while QRO is anything beyond
this.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity let us pick 5W as typified QRP and 80W as
allegedly "average" power level denoted QRO in the subsequent text.</p>
<h2 id="is-qrp-a-disadvantage">Is QRP a disadvantage?</h2>
<p>Most of all, let us not try to "judge" any op for choosing a power
class which is not the one of our preference. All power levels have their
advantages and disadvantages and all operators may undergo certain
frustrations which are typical for the power level. The goal of this text
is to minimize any frustration which may be caused by poor operating
techniques.</p>
<p>Of course, a restricted power is an operational disadvantage, indeed.
The most straightforward way to overcome the disadvantage is by optimizing
antenna systems. If the QRP effect cannot be entirely compensated by more
efficient antennas the operating skill becomes more and more important. It
is worthwhile to study propagation. Many ham radio journals offer
propagation forecasts, F2-layer models are widely available, and the
Internet is an important resource, too. Since a nowcast is always better
than a forecast it makes sense to check the cluster of the reverse beacon
network. Without Internet access, a regular observation of the IPB beacons
is recommended. The beacon dk0wcy delivers propagation information on
air.</p>
<h2 id="qro-point-of-view">QRO point of view</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>The QRO op wishes most of all that the qso partner can be read without
too much effort. Let's face it, most operators may be willing to undergo
considerable efforts to work "new ones" (typically new DXCC entities or
other "rare birds") but few invest much to get one more station from more
common countries like the US, Russia, Germany, or Italy. The implicit
request is "Do not bother me with unreadable code". The QRP operator
should acknowledge the fact that the station on the other end of the ray
path has the more difficult task, i.e. to read the weaker signal. QRP
operators will soon find out that their CQ calls are often overheard, and
that it makes sense to watch out for CQ calls themselves. When a QRP op
hears a CQ call a reasonable work hypothesis is that the calling station
is using about 80W. Compared to 5W this makes up a difference of 2 S-meter
levels. The QRP station must ask the following question: would I feel like
answering this CQ call if it were 2 S-levels weaker than it is? If the
answer to this question is a clear no it is better not to reply and watch
out for another CQ caller. This is just a rule of thumb. If the CQ caller
happens to use 1 kW he would hear you 4 S-levels weaker than you hear him,
at leasts that's what the theory of wave propagation predicts. Yet, there
may be some non-reciprocity to defeat this rule. The general advice is
that a little try may not do much harm, but do not insist or feel
frustrated if you fail when trying your luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may happen that the QRO station has to copy real weak signals. In
this case, the QRP op should grant the QRO station the leadership over
this QSO. The QRP operator should listen carefully to the requests and
instructions of the QRO station. It it asks something like "NAME?" the
answer should be something like "PETER PETER PETER KN" instead of a
lengthy over including much overhead. The QRP op should refrain from
overloading the call by a /QRP extension, at least a repetition of this
extension should be avoided. Please do not record the extended call in a
memory keyer. The /QRP extension may make some sense when calling CQ far
away from traditional QRP frequencies but in most cases it is more burden
than gain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QRO operator has a right not to be exposed to poor code, i.e. the
QRP operator has to make sure to transmit well formed and error free code
with precise character spacings and generous spaces between words. The QRP
operator <em>should</em> send <em>slower code</em> than the QRO
station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QRP operator should respect directed calls. Do not answer CQ DX if
you are not DX, do not answer CQ SKCC if you are not SKCC, even if you do
not know what SKCC means. If you are blunt by nature and if you have
reason to believe that the caller has a good and generous heart, and if
you think you may override the directed call by your answer, at least keep
your call short and give the caller a chance to overhear you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QRP ops should be more patient and more tolerant than others, they
should not police anyone for calling CQ 3 kHz away from a QRP frequency.
Likewise, QRO operators hardly abuse QRP calling frequencies since they
are mentioned by the band plan which is respected by all decent radio
amateurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least the QRO station expects any QRP op to have an above
average operational skill. A decent QRP op is expected to know the
relevant shorts and Q-codes such as QRK, QSY, QSX, QSV, QSZ, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="qrp-point-of-view">QRP point of view</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>The QRO station should acknowledge that QRP is a legitimate choice, at
times imposed by factors beyond the control of the QRP station such as the
lack of resources, or an oversensitive RFI environment, or restrictions
from 3rd parties. Keeping this in mind, a QSO partner should always show
the good will to finish any QSO. Formally it takes no more than the
exchange of calls and reports to finish a QSO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The QRO station should give <em>honest</em> RST reports. Especially the
R number is crucial. R4 means to be able to copy <em>without
difficulty</em>. If you consider a signal hard to copy you <em>must</em>
tell and give R3. If you anticipate problems be honest enough to give R2.
If you feel unable to copy the call it is ok to reject the QSO giving R1
or QRK1 which is essentially the same. If the QRO station sends a
stereotype RST 599 or even a 559 the QRP is authorized to believe that the
R5 means that the QRO station has indeed an armchair copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QRO stations should keep a reasonable distance from the QRP calling
frequencies, at least for CQ calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the band plan mentions the calling frequency and while these are
well-respected (at least weekdays) the band plan does not give any hint
about preferred places for QRP. In practice, QRP stations tend to settle
around the calling frequencies (nn060 kHz on 80/20/15/10m) with the
tendency to stay between the calling frequency and the upper band end. QRO
stations working there should be prepared to be called by QRP stations. If
a QRO station feels annoyed and molested by QRP it may wish to avoid these
frequencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QRO operators with a generous spirit should occasionally check the
preferred QRP frequencies and answer cq calling QRP stations using QRP
themselves because QRP operators are especially fond of two-way QRP
contacts.</p>
</li>
