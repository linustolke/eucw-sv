<h1 id="cw-decoding">CW decoding</h1>
<p>There are two types of decoding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A1A - manual decoding using the human brain and ear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A1B - machine decoding by technical systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction refers to the decoding only, encoding is not relevant.
An op using a keyboard for CW generation is still an A1A op.</p>
<h2 id="hints-for-a1b-op">Hints for A1B op</h2>
<p>Let us suppose that you have never studied the Morse code yourself and
that you are trying to use the PC to perform a CW QSO. The first insight
is that you belong to a small minority, by far most CW op are using A1A,
i.e. they decode their transmission by ear. Likewise, they generate their
code using elbugs, straight keyers or bugs, i.e. their CW is less perfect
than computer CW.</p>
<p>You will find out that some station can hardly be decoded by you
machine, while others decode perfectly well. The reason is the encoding.
Those who are using mechanical keys have a better chance to create
corrupted text on your screen than those who are using a keyboard or a
fully electronic keyer with auto-spacing. However, what looks corrupted
on a screen might still be an armchair copy for a trained Morse code enthusiast.</p>
<p>While a screen with a chaotic text may disturb you most A1A op
simply ignore/overhear little errors and other problems with inconsistent
pauses as long as these problems stay within a normal margin of error.
Here are a few hints that will help you to get the most out of your CW
program:</p>
<p>• It is better to answer CQ calls over calling CQ yourself because this
gives you a first idea whether or not you will be able to copy your QSO
partner well enough. Start with loud signals which look nice on the
screen.</p>
<p>• Do not mute you audio. This will help you to understand if there is
interference on the frequency, moreover, it is good practice to listen to
Morse code in order to train your ability to estimate the speed. Be
careful with the speed setting of your Morse encoding program. Never set
your encoder speed higher than the speed given by the decoder. Do not use
the default value of the encoder, it may be too fast. While most
experienced A1A hams can read up to 30 wpm, the average speed in QSO
practice is under 20 wpm. Many CW hams with moderate activity can hardly
copy 15 wpm. The conversion formula for speed units is: char/min = 5 times
words/min. Example: 20 words per minute are equal to 100 chars per min.
Speed is indeed your worst error source, expect CW to be much slower than
most other digital modes. It is ok to start using 15 wpm if you are not
yet acquainted with A1B.</p>
<p>• Start your first contacts outside the overcrowded DX section of the
bands at the lower band end.</p>
<p>• Before you go on air read the manual of your digital program. Most CW
programs can generate all prosigns (special symbols used in CW) but it is
hard to guess the key mappings for these Morse symbols. Do not try to
"approximate" a break point prosign -...- by 'bt' which will certainly
generate -... - which is unpleasant in a CW qso. Do not take it for
granted that the break point prosign is mapped to the key '=' (though such
mapping makes sense). Consult your manual.</p>
<p>• Consider writing dedicated macros for CW operation, and if you do,
please avoid verbosity. Remember CW is slower than PSK or RTTY. Keep in
mind that most CW QSOs are slow enough that you can type directly into the
keyboard. By all means avoid punctuation characters as much as you can,
many CW op hate punctuation. If your language is other than English be
careful with accented letters or umlauts. Your digital program might
encode them incorrectly or your QSO partner might not be familiar with
special Morse characters. Do NOT use your PSK macros, their style is too
different from normal CW style QSOs, some PSK macros produce nasty CW code
(e.g. those with dot series like Name:...........John).</p>
<p>• If you fill out a QSL card, just use CW. If you are brave and honest,
you may use CW/A1B. Do not use A1B alone because machine decoded CW is not
the only A1B available in ham radio. Feld-Hell mode is A1B, too. Anyway,
there is no need to conceal that you are using a computer for decoding. On
the contrary, your QSO partner might appreciate this indication and he may
switch over to a CW generator which makes life easier for both of you.</p>
<p>• Be aware of the fact that A1B is a poor tool for DXing just like most
digital modes. If you need to boost your DXCC record the best advice is to
learn at least the sound of your own call sign. To monitor a DX-frequency
by a decoder is bound to fail because of the qrm. Accept it as a fact that
human ear and brain are hard to beat in DX pile ups.</p>
<p>Last but not least - be aware of the fact that A1B/CW is a relatively
weak digital mode. Its main advantage is that it is an interface between
operators with computers and without computers. CW is more suited to human
operators. Computers are doing a better job with other codes. Do not
expect miracles from A1B.</p>
<p>To get full access to the world of Morse code it is necessary to learn
it. A1B may be a good point to have your first encounter with CW, however,
A1B practice is not really helpful to learn the code. Very few A1B
operators will ever be able to upgrade smoothly to A1A without a dedicated
training program. Should you ever feel like learning the code it is best
to take a break from A1B practice and dedicate the time to CW lessons.</p>
<h2 id="hints-for-an-a1a-op-in-contact-with-an-a1b-op.">Hints for an A1A
op in contact with an A1B op.</h2>
<p>The first step is to recognize an A1B op as such. A1B op are using
keyboards and the generated CW tends to be impeccable. A keyboard will
never send a dot too much but the op may hit a wrong key. Some A1B op send
pretty fast, others may be recognized by their macros. A typical style
element is the use of the loc on HF or the short 'btu' (both are rarely
used by traditional CW op). What should an A1A op do when in contact with
A1B?</p>
<p>• Do not adapt to the speed of the A1B op but use the speed that you
are most comfortable with. Consider that decoders are very unforgiving,
every little error or imprecision will make you look ugly on that other
screen.</p>
<p>• If you have connected several keyers to your tx, use the one which
produces the best code, first choice is a keyboard, second choice is an
elbug with auto-spacing switched on. A computer will not be able to
appreciate the beauty of bug swing.</p>
<p>• Many A1B op are newcomers, please offer them a QSL card.</p>
<p>The most important rule is to make your QSO partner feel happy about
the QSO, there is nothing wrong with A1B, nowadays it is a typical mode to
get in touch with CW. The A1B op of today may be the A1A of tomorrow.
Would the old timers have learned CW had it not been compulsory? Certainly
not all of them.</p>
