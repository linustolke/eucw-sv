GENERAL 
    EuCW invites all Short Wave Listening amateurs to take part
    in the annual EuCW QRS WEEK  over five days, Monday-Friday,
    in April each year. This is not a contest . Just enjoy plenty of
    slow Morse activity for a period of five days. The dates selected
    are intended to avoid weekend contest activity. 

DATES/TIMES  
    From Monday 0000z to Friday 2359z in the week after the 4th
    Sunday in April.

MODE CW/A1A
    The use of machine decoders is not recommended. In technical
    terms we want A1A and not A1B.

OPERATION
    Recommended areas of activity, +/- 10 kHz of the 
    calling frequencies below. Don't expect this to be a mass
    event, so try these frequencies and if you do not hear any
    QRS monitor the calling frequencies.

SPEEDS  
    Maximum speed 14 words per minute (70cpm). 
    Avoid logging QSOs from stations that operate substantially
    faster than this speed, at least one station should be QRS.
    Note that the speeds of CQ calls get logged by the Reverse
    Beacon system.
    
LOGS AND SCORING 
    Log one QSO per line and mark day, time, and band.
    Log any detail you are able to pick up.
    You will be credited with 1 Point for every detail you can copy 
    on air once per band and per day.
    - call A and call B
    - RST sent by A and B
    - both NAMES as used on the air
    - both QTHs as given on the air
    - Antenna, Power, etc. as long as this is verifiable

    Examples:

    DATE:27/4
    UTC  BND CALL_A INFOS_FROM_A      CALL_B INFOS_FROM_B
    1544 80m DL0XXX 579 LUDWIG BONN   F6KXX  569 JEAN PARIS 90W
    1552 40m DK3??  ??? EDDI          RZ3EXX ??? ???  OREL  5W,G5RV
    1559 40m G2AAA  578 JIM    ???    OK1KXX 599 ???  PRAHA 100W,LW
    1609 80m DL0XXX 559 LUDWIG BONN   F4AAA  599 LUC  NIMES

    Partially correct info will enhance your score, wrong guesses
    can reduce your score. Don't take it for granted that all RST
    are 599. If you claim 599 and the log of the sender proofs you
    wrong you will suffer a point loss. If the call books says e.g.
    I1AAA's name is Luciano and you log him as such you will
    get a penalty if he sends a log claiming he used "Luke" as
    a handle.
    The scores for the above QSOs will be 9, 5.5, 8, 4 unless RZ3EXX
    and OK1KXX don't send a log and make a verification impossible,
    If there are dupes like in the case of DL0XXX, the entry with
    the most points will be used for the score.

    The general idea behind the scoring system is to make it as
    attractive as possible to copy all data on air and to discourage
    SWLs to "borrow" data from the cluster, callbook, or machine
    decoders. When in doubt, mark an entry with a question mark.
