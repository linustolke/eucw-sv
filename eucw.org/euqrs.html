<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p>The EuCW cordially invites all radio amateurs and SWLs to take
part in the annual EuCW QRS Activity Week. This is not a contest,
on the contrary, it is an invitation to slow down CW speeds and to
enjoy plenty of slow Morse activity for a period of five days. The
dates selected are intended to avoid weekend contest activity. The
goal is not self-exposure and competitiveness but to lower the
threshold for newcomers to give CW a try. The right spirit is to
take part in this as a service to potential newcomers. This won't
get YOU closer to any Hall of Fame, this will help others while
your patience might be stretched a little.</p>
<p>Work any station, including members of EuCW clubs, but send only
in QRS. Standard QSOs with non-participating stations can be
included in logs.</p>
<p>The EuCW Week has a history dating back to 2001 when it was
introduced by FISTS. The EuCW thanks FISTS for having this
excellent idea and for doing all the work for an entire decade.
Since 2012 the EuCW QRS work is organized by AGCW. Recognitions for
the most active participants are issued,</p>
<p>Those who wish to indicate distinguished participants may
include up to three votes for the special recognition "Most
Readable Morse Heard" (one vote per station). If you wish not to
execute this right please state this in your log, too.</p>
<h3>DATES/TIMES</h3>
<p>From Monday 0000z to Friday 2359z in the week after the 4th
Sunday in April.</p>
<pre>
    Examples:
    2025: April 28, 00:00 UTC thru May 2, 23:59 UTC
    2026: April 27, 00:00 UTC thru May 1, 23:59 UTC
    2027: April 26, 00:00 UTC thru April 30, 23:59 UTC
    2028: April 24, 00:00 UTC thru April 28, 23:59 UTC
</pre>
<h3>MODE</h3>
CW/A1A (No machine decoders allowed)
<h3>CLASSES</h3>
<br>
A - More than 10w input or 5w output power<br>
B - QRP (10w input or 5w output, or less)<br>
C - Short wave listeners.<br>
<p>There is also an invisible class of participating EuCW clubs.
You may dedicate your participation to a EuCW club of your
preference. Add your club name and number to the log please. You
may publicize your club membership in your QSOs but there is no
obligation to do this. I would not recommend to confuse newcomers
with club acronyms and cryptic 5 digit numbers.</p>
<h3>CALL</h3>
<p>No targeted call required but "CQ QRS" may be useful to be
detected as participant committed to this activity. Experienced
operaters should call CQ as much as possible because newcomers tend
to be shy and they prefer to select stations they can easily
read.</p>
<p>Recommended (no obligation) areas of activity: +/- 10 kHz of the
center frequencies below, including WARC bands (see below).</p>
<p>As always, non-QRP stations should avoid calling CQ on the
popular QRP frequencies (see below). Do not use frequencies outside
the 'CW ONLY' bands as defined by the current band plan. Since this
activity is not a contest there is no need to stay within the
'contest preferred bands'.</p>
<h3>KEYS/SPEEDS</h3>
<p>Use any type of key or keyer. No keyboard sending or
pre-programmed messages from computers or keyers, but
pre-programmed CQ calls or CQ loops are permitted. Maximum speed 14
words per minute (70cpm). If a responding operator uses slower CW
the caller should adapt his speed accordingly. Users of CQ loops
should not discourage their callers by switching to very personal
(hard to read) swing after the CQ call.</p>
<h3>CONTACTS</h3>
<p>Minimal duration of a QSO is FIVE minutes. Normal friendly QSOs,
no special requirements. QSOs with any station may be logged. Work
any station in any country, including stations not taking part in
the QRS Party but try to persuade them to work QRS.</p>
<p>Give realistic RST values, refrain from a stereotype 599.</p>
<p>We follow the principle that all stations are equal no matter
how shiny their prefix or suffix may be. The goal is to obtain the
amount of QRS signals as high as possible, so please work your QSO
partners every day.</p>
<h3>LOGS</h3>
<p>All logs consist of two parts: a HEADER (traditionally called
summary sheet) and a QSO LIST.</p>
<h3>LOG HEADERS</h3>
<pre>
    Minimum header data:

    1) Own call sign
    2) Name and qth (as used in QRS Week)
    3) Return address 
    4) EuCW club of preference (only one, and you have to be a mbr)
    5) Class (a=qro or b=qrp or c=swl)
    6) Number of valid QSOs
    7) Your votes for most distinguished operator: "Most Readable Morse"
    8) Your preference for recognitions: PDF or paper. 
</pre>
<p>You are encouraged to add as much detail as you wish. You may
wish to document details of your transmission such as alternative
QTHs (a station in Chelmsford may have the habit to identify the
town only in UK contacts, while the op might use "ESSEX" as qth
with EU and "NR LONDON" with DX). Some may vary their handle, e.g.
a DL may use Karl-Heinz locally, Karl inside DL, and Chas for DX.
If you choose to be inconsistent when you identify your club you
may wish to mention this, too. The added-value would be that
additional detail is useful for (potential) SWL logs. Last but not
least you should tell me whether you prefer an electronic
recognition (PDF) or one one paper just in case you turn out to be
one of the most active stations</p>
<h3>LOG QSO DATA</h3>
<pre>
    Minimum QSO list columns 

    1) Date (as YYYYMMDD) 
    2) Time as UTC (as HHMM) 
    3) Call (other stn) 
    4) Band 
    5) Mode (=CW) 
    6) RST given to other stn 
    7) RST received fm other stn 
    8) Name received fm other stn 
    9) QTH of other stn given on air

Try to avoid logging software which fills name and qth fields out of
call book or Internet lookups. Instead, log what you hear on the air.
</pre>
<p>For RST given, RST received, Name, and QTH, the columns must be
included but incorrect or missing values in them are acceptable.
You are encouraged to add as much detail as you wish, e.g. tx, ant,
wx of the other stn</p>
<h3>LOG SUBMISSION</h3>
<p>LOG SUBMISSION depends on your logging style. One of three cases
apply.</p>
<pre>
    I) You log is in ADIF format.
       <a href="euqrsi.html">Click here for example log I</a>
    II) Your log is a simple list in ASCII text (csv) 
       <a href="euqrsii.html">Click here for example log II</a>
    III) Your log is on paper (email a picture/scan) 
       <a href="euqrsiii.html">Click here for example log III</a>
</pre>
<p>I) Users of logging software export their log as ADIF files
(extension .adi) and verify the presence of the minimum data.
Please do not forget to add the header data and put them in the
text of your email. NOTE: Check the ADIF file visually for the
presence of all elements, some ADIF creators may omit relevant
fields. BEST PRACTICE: Download the FISTS Log Converter and use it
to post-process your log (See chapter RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE).</p>
<p>II) If you transfer a log manually the best choice is to pass
the data to a logging software and export as ADIF as above. If you
wish to create your files manually from scratch with an editor or
spread sheet software please create .txt or .csv files in plain
ASCII code that do not require a particular software. If asked for
a delimiter choose semicolon. Don't forget the header data.</p>
<p>III) Manual Logs are quite ok, the least painful procedure is to
go to a copy shop and to draw photocopies from the original log.
Another idea is to ask a relative or friend to take a picture of
the log, verify the readability and email it.</p>
<p>The predominant idea is that any log is better than no log at
all just as a partial qso is better than no qso. The EuCW QRS is
primarily not a competition but an opportunity for CW newcomers and
CW skeptics to enjoy Morse code without fear from excessive speeds.
If you have a choice, please send a Log in format II. Some users
find it hard not to use their spread sheet programs. If you belong
to these, please fill all entries in all records and please use the
yyyymmdd format.</p>
<h3>RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE</h3>
<p>http://fists.co.uk/members/membersflc.html The free FISTS Log
Converter for Windows should be used to create log submissions for
EuCW QRS Week. It can either read QSOs from an ADIF file exported
from most logbook programs, or if you don't currently use a logbook
program, its own logbook feature can be used to create an
electronic log from scratch. Users of other operating systems may
prefer logging style I. If you are using a modern logging software please
switch off the autofill option adding name or qth by using a local or remote
database. You must enter the on-air names and the qth used on air, otherwise
a penalty is possible.
</p>
<h3>SEND LOGS TO</h3>
<img src="qrs.png" alt= "ik2-rmz">
<h3>DEADLINE</h3>
<p>Log must arrive not later than 31st May</p>
<h3>FREQUENCY ACTIVITY CENTERS</h3>
<p>Recommended area of activity +/- 10 kHz from the activity
centers as follows:</p>
<pre>
    2m 144.065 MHz (avoid 144050 because of the E_s season)
    6m Use any frequency compatible with the IARU band plan
    10m 28.055 MHz (Recommended IARU frequency for QRS)
    12m 24.905 MHz 
    15m 21.055 MHz (Recommended IARU frequency for QRS)
    17m 18.085 MHz 
    20m 14.055 MHz (Recommended IARU frequency for QRS)
    30m 10.125 MHz 
    40m  7.035 MHz (stay in the exclusive CW band 7000-7040 kHz)
    80m  3.555 MHz (Recommended IARU frequency for QRS) 
    160m Use any frequency compatible with the IARU band plan
</pre>
<p>QRP CW Calling Frequencies to be avoided by non-QRP (cq calling)
stations. 1843; 3560; 7030; 10116; 14060; 18096; 21060; 24906;
28060 kHz.</p>
<p>Under good North America condx 14056.5, 18091.5, 21056.5,
10122.5 are often used as frequencies of the Mobile Emergency and
County Hunters Net where dozens of stations participate.</p>
<p>These recommendations are given as a help to find other QRS
partners they are not binding. However, decent operators know and
respect the IARU band plan which is established by the
international community of hams. Download a copy of the band plan
at iaru.org before switching on a TX. Try to avoid the lower end of
the CW bands.</p>
<p>New friends of CW who do not yet feel ready to put their CW on
air are invited to read the <a href="euqrsswl.html">SWL</a>
rules.</p>
