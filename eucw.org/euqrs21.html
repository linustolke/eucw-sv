Soap Box:

2e0dph Only 3 but that's how it goes sometimes.
dg1ehm Thank you!
dl3gj  I completed my first CW QSO in March 2021 - so I am still a beginner.
       But because of home office I did progress a little. 
g4lhi  A very enjoyable event,but conditions on HF not very good,there
       did not seem as many stations taking part this year, not many
       stations were calling CQ EUCW QRS. Very many thanks to the
       organisers of this event & may it continue
m0uze  Thank you, stay safe


Comments from the editor: 

Phil, 2E0DPH, thanks for sending in the log anyway. Every log is precious
and every QSO is precious, including those that do not appear in our
records.
Grzegorz, DL3GJ, You achieved the Bronze award from scratch, this is
some achievement for a newcomer. Welcome to EUCW activities. Please
join our Snakes And Ladders activity, too.
Peter, G4LHI, is right about the CQ calling. Yet, the directional call
to participants is optional. It is optional on purpose in order to keep
the event as open as possible.  Peter, you have done an excellent job,
being a Gold award and MRM winner and 2nd in the Reverse Beacon Network
count. Thanks for the faithful support.
