EuCW Bulletin No 2021/04 
========================

1) The ICWC published its website:
https://internationalcwcouncil.org/icwc-accomplishments/ 
It's full of interesting info about the Association and its members. EuCW
is a founder member of ICWC we support the ICWC mission. In fact, The
International CW Council (ICWC) comprised of representatives from CW
clubs world-wide, promotes and aids in the retention and growth of
International Morse Code as a mode of communication between amateur
radio operators. The ICWC Accomplishments: CWops Giving Back Program:
The ICWC coordinated an effort from its members, which doubled
participation and increased the scope and frequency of this worldwide,
daily event focused on getting new operators on the air. UNESCO
Program: ICWC gave its support to the initiative to add Morse Code to
the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Program. For any more info,
you can write to: info@internationalcwcouncil.org.

2) Defending the IARU band plans. I'd like to invite you to send to
the EuCW Chairman or to the EuCW officers any info about violations
of the IARU band plans, so we can contact the authors to ask them to
immediately stop their activities.

3) EuCW Snakes & Ladders Robert, DM4RW, the S&L EuCW manager is doing
a fine job concerning the activity of promoting the Snakes & Ladders
EuCW activity. We invite all the EuCW members to take part to this
"game", which is not a contest, not an award, not a "competition", but
a very useful activity in order to use - in particular - the upper
segments of each band which we must frequent more and more. It's a
very good way to let novices practice with rag-chew (each QSO must
be longer than 5 minutes); more info on our website at the page:
https://eucw.org/sl.html. If you want to be an active participant
you have to be on air in CW and work at least one European station per
month. You must have an email account and be able to produce a log in
ADIF format: so -- come on! Let's join and -- enjoy it.

4) A1CLUB Straight key contest Hiro, JJ1FXF, informs us about
the A1CLUB STRAIGHT KEY CONTEST, which will be held on this
coming Sunday, October 31st, 6:00-12:00 UTC. Please see:

5) EuCW novice award. This Award is available to any radio amateur
who, during the first 12 months of holding an amateur licence contacts
50 different stations while using CW, for which QSL cards have been
received. An applicant does not have to be a member of an EuCW club
to qualify for an EuCW Novice Award. Classes of Award Class A - QRP
must be used, and the applicant must enclose with his/her application
a signed statement that when making the contacts listed the power
used did not exceed 5W output. Class B - Any licensed power may be
used. Applications To obtain the award, send a log of the 50 contacts
made, verified by one other licensed amateur stating that he/she has
seen and checked the cards on the list. The applicant's own name
and address must be written clearly on the application. Do not send
QSL cards. Send the claim, together with three first class stamps
(UK applicants), or three international reply coupons (IRCs) from
