<P>
The Radio Telegraphy Very High Speed Club VHSC was founded on May
1st 1961 under protection of VERON and DARC and has the intention to
gather radio amateurs who are able to transmit and to copy very high
speed telegraphy, and doing so, to encourage CW-Traffic in general
and QRQ-Traffic in particular.
<P>
<B>How to join the VHSC
</B>
<P>
Be active on the bands, using telegraphy speed of 40
wpm or higher, and show your ability to read and key this speed
perfectly. VHSC-Members may give you a recommendation for the
VHSC-Membership. Do not ask for a recommendation, do not chase
for it!  Just show your capability of solid copy and excellent
keying at a speed of at least 40 wpm!   A recommendation can be
made after having 2-way-CW contact -- with a VHSC-Member -- for at
least 30 minutes using telegraphy speed of 200 letters per minute
or higher. (PARIS-base, 40 wpm). Solid copy should be made by the
applicant together with excellent keying. No keyboards or decoders
are allowed during these contacts.  A recommendation is valid for
maximum 3 years.  After having 4 recommendations in your possession,
send then with your application for VHSC-Membership and EUR 10 to the
VHSC-Secretary.
The call of a VHSC-candidate will be published in our VHSC-bulletin,
this is a news sheet which is sent to all members. If there are no
objections raised by VHSC members within 3 months the VHSC-candidate
can be registered as a VHSC-member.  
<P>
All recommendations must show the duration of the VHSC-test-QSO
and must mention the CW-speed used during that VHSC-test-QSO. All
applications should contain statement, that the applicant did not used
a keyboard or decoder during the four (4) test-QSOs.  A certificate
of membership is sent to members.  There is no further payment for
life membership. Applications should be addressed to the secretary of
the VHSC:
