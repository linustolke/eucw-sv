<PRE>

A big thanks to the EUCW community for the best QRS Week in
history. 36 logs were received and the logs were in very good
quality. A special thanks also to our software author G3ZOD who
keeps on supporting the QRSW in his FISTS log converter.

Err count:
Missing or misspelt QTH, Name, or RST were given a penalty of
0.2. Misspelt call signs were given a penalty of 0.4 points. The
underlying idea is that any QSO is better than no qso. We
are not interested in scores or rankings since this is not a
contest. Otherwise we would have calculated the scores with the
formula: Score = QSO - Err


Clubs

AGCW  284
BQC    30
FISTS 509
FOC    19
GTC    10
HSC     5
INORC  33
OECWG  79
RUQRP  10

Any participant declaring a club dedicates points to this club
according to the formula: 100 x QSO points / QSO points of the
class winner. A class winner contributes 100 points to his
club. Traditionally, FISTS scores best, just as last year, and
the two years before.

The MRM score is the sum of the QSO points of the declaring
stations. If you have 23 qso points and declare station A in your
MRM list, station A will receive 23 MRM points. This makes sense
because those who work more stations can judge the operation
qualities of a station with more competence. At least this is
the theory, in practice, the bonus points are usually given to
friends :-)


RBN Award  

As a counterpoise to the arbitrary character of the MRM award,
the RBN award counts simply the number of entries in the Reverse
Beacon Network during the QRS Week. RBN entries over 15 wpm were
discarded though. 

G0EML had 1014 RBN entries during the QRSW. He was the one and
only station with over 1000 entries. Well done Ray!

At the bottom line, the number of RBN entries is the most
important indicator for a good spirit. A high RBN count means to
be readable and to be available for newcomers to practice slow
code.


Soapbox:


G0ILN:
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.Only two contacts were QRO.All
other contacts were 5 Watts.Conditions were not very good and
a lot of the regulars seemed to be missing.
 
G0POT:
... was absolutely not QRS and didn't feel the need to slow down
to match my speed! What a brilliant week...lots of new(ish) and
very nervous fists worked including a first CW QSO for M3HXE. I
know (via Twitter) that many new Ops also enjoyed listening in to
QRS QSOs even if they didn't join in. It was great to work Robert
(DM4RW) as I love S&amp;L. Wish this event happened twice a year ;o)
 
G3JRH:
First time I've entered, very much enjoyed the week.
 
G3XVL:
Good fun,  enjoyed the event.
 
G4LHI:
I enjoyed this event as usual, but was very disappointed with
the lack of activity from some Fists Members &amp; other EUCW Clubs
that were always so active on this event in past years.Also
the very poor band conditions did not help. It must be very
disappointing for those who organize this &amp; other CW events,
that there seems to be a lack of interest. WHY?
 
M0DRK:
Many thanks for being the host for 2016 EUCW QRS Week, and good
to have a nice QSO with you on the firstday. As I am on radio
at random times during the day, there were many friends that I
did not meet this year, but thanks to all stations for giving
me points. I was not sure about working some stations a number
of times on the same day, but on different bands. However the
logging programme did accept them all.
 
M5ABN:
Great fun as always, and hope this week encourages new ops to
have a go at the best mode.
 
OE6GWG:
Viele QSO sind es nicht geworden aber es hat Spass gemacht.
 
OH7QR:
... Die Aktivit&auml;t hat mir viel Spass gemacht und ich habe auch
einige neue Freunde getroffen. Danke und 73!
 
ON7DQ:
My first attempt at this ... hope to make more QSO's next time !
 

Response to some comments:

To M0DRK: multiple contacts with the same station on the same
day but on different bands are ok. If it were not so the FISTS
converter software would reject the contacts. However, a practice
of band hopping with subsequent QSOs with the same station over many
bands is not really recommended even though this may boost the score.

To G4LHI: it is the nature of many such activities that they
will never become mass events. The rules of events like FISTS
ladders, EUCW Snakes and Ladders, SCAG Straight Key Day, and many
others look a bit as if they were contests. But they are not, and
contesters avoid them because they tend to avoid anything which
does not fit into standard contest software. Non contesters do
hardly ever check out such rules because they cannot imagine that
CW orgs have better ideas than organizing a contest. Knowing this
most activity managers are happy with every incoming log. This
year I am happier than ever since the logs were more than usual.

To G0POT: yes, some stations do not wish to slow down, even
if they should.  In the QRSW most QSOs are between genuine
participants and non-participants who have no idea about the
QRSW rules. It is good practice not to work at excessive speeds,
however, the CW population is aging and many elderly can still
copy at high speeds while they prefer to send slowly. This means
that the old rule that both stations should use the same speed
is slowly softening.
