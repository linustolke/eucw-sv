Motto: <B>CWFE</B> CW forever<P>
Founded on 1990.03.10 by 18 CW enthusiasts in the former GDR (Y2). The
goals are to preserve, foster, and encourage the use of CW in ham radio.
The emphasis is is on operator skills that handle CW without computers,
keyboards, and decoders.

Accepts any German (full membership) or foreign (associated membership)
CW enthusiast willing to join provided (s)he can give evidence of sufficient
CW activity on the bands.

This is measured by a scoring system: 500 points must be worked during the
12 months before the membership application. CW QSOs count one point, CW
awards count 50 points (at most 5 awards may be presented) and rag chew
QSOs of at least one hour duration contribute 50 points, too. The latter
must be documented by QSLs. Entrance fee is Euro or US$ 5.

The club operates the club stations DKØRTC and DLØRTC. Three awards are
issued, namely W-RTC-M, CWD, CWAA.
