  <h2>About Snakes and Ladders</h2>This activity is being
  introduced into the EuCW calendar for 2014. It will begin on
  1.April 2014 and run through until 31.March 2015. The goal of
  this activity is to promote the use of CW on the CW-portions of
  the amateur radio bands, and above all to stimulate operators to
  establish contacts with counterparts equally divided over Europe.
  Points may be earned by participants based on locator squares,
  reflecting their efforts to spread their CW activity over Europe.

  <p>A certificate will be awarded to every entrant who submits six
  or more scoring entries to the activity and an endorsement will
  be added to the certificate for those who submit a qualifying
  entry for every one of the twelve operating periods. Call-signs
  of participants who have earned 1st award, 2nd award and 3rd
  award, will be published on 1.June 2015 as part of a list of all
  participants and their points earned.</p>

  <p>Please note that this is an activity and not a contest.
  Operators are encouraged to have relaxed QSOs, that take at least
  five minutes to complete. The activity should be equally
  accessible for the experienced as well as the new operators, so
  where necessary speed should be reduced (QRS).</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>The activity is based on the well-known board game Snakes and
  Ladders. A version of the game is also known as Chutes and
  Ladders. It is a classic board game, wherein the board is divided
  into 100 squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's
  game piece, according to dice rolls, from the start (bottom
  square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders
  and snakes respectively. Ladders progress a player towards the
  finish, snakes regress him towards the start. In our version of
  the game the board is made up from the map of the continent of
  Europe and the individual squares are the locator squares on the
  map (see section &#8220;European Countries and Locator
  Squares&#8221;). Ladders and snakes are derived from the total
  set of QSOs provided for a complete period of activity, as
  further explained below (see section &#8220;The Activity
  Manager&#8221;). Contacts can be made on any band from 160M to 2M
  (60M and 4M excluded), but always in accordance with IARU Region
  1 band plans applicable at the time of the contact. Contacts must
  be CW and must be made point-to-point, excluding contacts made
  through repeaters and satellites. Any station may be contacted
  and logged only once on any day per band. A qualifying contact
  must be made station to station. In a multi-station net, an
  individual station to station QSO outside of the net must be
  established to qualify for this activity.</p>

  <h2>The Activity Manager</h2>

  <p>EuCW will appoint a single Activity Manager to oversee the
  Snakes and Ladders Activity from April 2014 until its conclusion
  in March 2015 and the announcement of results in June 2015.</p>

  <p>Decisions made by the Activity Manger will be final and no
  correspondence will be entered into. Any decision made by the
  Activity Manager in an individual case will be applied to every
  entry to the activity.</p>

  <p>Entries may be submitted at the end of an operating period.
  The Activity Manager will adjudicate the entries received during
  the fourteen (14) days following the activity period. The
  Activity Manager will ensure that all entries conform to the
  format(s) required by the rules and that participation is in the
  spirit of the activity and of ham radio more generally.</p>

  <h2>Nomination of squares</h2>

  <p>The Activity Manager will derive four (4) active grid squares
  with lowest activity recorded (the treasure squares!) from the
  data set of the operating period concerned. These grid squares
  will be nominated as ladders or ladder squares. If more than four
  squares with recorded activity tie for lowest activity, they will
  all become ladder squares for that period.</p>

  <p>The Activity Manager will also identify the Snakes in a
  similar manner. The three (3) squares with most recorded activity
  (the easy squares!) will be designated snakes or snake squares.
  If more than three (3) squares tie in any combination, then they
  will all be combined to create three groups of snake squares.
  Square locators can only become snake once every three months,
  i.e. once a square is snake, it cannot become snake in the
  succeeding two periods of activity. The next squares qualifying
  for snake will then be considered. Active square locators that
  are neither ladder (or treasure) square nor snake (or easy)
  square, are referred to as normal locator squares, or just normal
  squares.</p>

  <h2>Scoring</h2>

  <p>Anyone claiming a contact in a ladder square will climb the
  ladder by being awarded twenty-five (25) points for a first
  ladder square, and five (5) additional points for the second and
  third, wherein the three squares need to be different. Only up to
  three (3) unique ladder squares will count per period of
  activity. Those landing on a Snake by claiming a contact in that
  square will slide down the snake: the highest level by fifteen
  (15) points, the next by ten (10) points, the lowest by five (5)
  points, wherein the highest level relates to the square with
  highest activity. Per period of activity, only one (the highest
  ranking) snake can bite, and only if directly before a ladder was
  climbed. It can also not bite if in the current period a ladder
  is climbed. For the first fifteen (15) normal squares, five (5)
  points are given for each three (3) unique squares. The number of
  contacts made in any square is irrelevant.</p>
 
  <a href='sl-scoring.pdf'>Scoring examples</a>

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <p>The results for a period of activity will be announced on or
  before the last day of the calendar month that follows the period
  of activity. The results announced every month will comprise a
  listing of the call-signs of all participants, the treasure and
  easy locator squares with their associated points, as well as the
  call-signs of participants who ended up on a treasure and/or an
  easy square. Based on these results, participants can themselves
  determine their points collected so far. Intermediate overviews
  of points collected will be published three times, as indicated
  below, for integrity-checking purposes. A final overview of
  points collected will only be announced on the first of June
  2015. Intermediate and final overviews shall be listed by
  call-sign in ascending alphabetical order.</p>

  <h2>European countries and locator squares</h2>

  <p>Contacts with stations in European countries will count
  towards a tally for this activity. That definition includes
  land-based fixed, portable and mobile stations and stations
  operated from fresh water and inland waterways within a European
  country as well as tidal waters of a European country. It
  excludes stations operating Maritime Mobile (/MM) in
  international waters. A list of countries considered European for
  this activity, can be found in the appendix.</p>

  <p>In any individual entry to the Snakes and Ladders Activity,
  the Activity Manager's decision on the recognition of a European
  state will be final; that decision will be applied to every entry
  for that calendar period. The definition of a European sovereign
  state will be defined on the first day of each calendar month and
  no updates to the list of qualifying states will be made until
  the first day of the next qualifying calendar month. The grid
  squares representing the board squares that represent the Snakes
  and Ladders within the map of Europe, are the 1o by 2o squares of
  the Maidenhead Locator System, also known as Grid Locator Squares
  or IARU Locator Squares, or more simply as Grid Squares. The 1o
  by 2o squares are represented by a four-character reference, two
  alpha-characters and two numerics (e.g. JN58 for Munich area).
  Please visit one of the many sources for Maidenhead Locator
  information for specific information or other sources to identify
  European sovereign states.</p>

  <h2>Operating frequencies</h2>

  <p>Recommended areas of activity are the upper 10 kHz of the
  dedicated CW portion of all bands from 160m to 2m, 60m and 4m
  excluded. These 10kHz regions have been chosen, because they lie
  outside of the recommended areas for contests. But obviously the
  whole CW-band may be used for making contacts, the recommended
  areas are not binding. The following is therefore to be taken as
  an indication:</p>
  <pre>
 160m: 1.828 -  1.838 MHz (1.836MHz: QRP activity centre)
 80m:  3.570 -  3.580 MHz
 40m:  7.030 -  7.040 MHz (7.030MHz: QRP activity centre)
 30m: 10.130 - 10.140 MHz
 20m: 14.060 - 14.070 MHz (14.060 MHz: QRP activity centre)
 17m: 18.085 - 18.095 MHz (18.086 MHz: QRP activity centre)
 15m: 21.060 - 21.070 MHz (21.060 MHz: QRP activity centre)
 12m: 24.905 - 24.915 MHz (24.906MHz: QRP activity centre)
 10m: 28.060 - 28.070 MHz (28.060MHz: QRP activity centre)
 6m: 50.090  - 50.100 MHz
 2m: 144.100 -144.110 MHz
</pre>

NOTE: QRP calling frequencies are to be avoided by non-QRP
operators

  <h2>Exchange</h2>

  <p>A qualifying contact shall include at least the exchange of
  the following information, i.e. each station should send all of
  these items of information:</p>
  <pre>
Call signs of both stations
On-air name or nickname
QTH 
   city, town or village OR Maidenhead 1o by 2o square as
   four-character reference; portable stations should preferably send
   their grid locator Signal report &#8211; preferably as RST
</pre>
Entries Entries must be received by the Activity Manager by
email (SL(at)eucw.org) before the eighth day of the month that
follows the period of operation being recorded. Late entries must
and will be excluded, see also the table above. Entries may be
submitted for each operating period. There are twelve (12)
operating periods of a calendar month each, beginning on the first
day of the calendar month and ending on the last day of that month.
All times shall be in Universal Time Coordinated or ZULU time. Each
entry must contain the following information:
  <pre>
 Period of activity (i.e. calendar month)
 Call sign(s) used on air
 Operator's name and email
 Total number of contacts made (for integrity-checking purposes)
 Log entry for each individual contact
</pre>
Wherein each log entry must contain:
  <pre>
 Date and time, preferably on and off times should be included
 Band
 Station contacted
 Signal report sent and received
 Operator's name received
 Operator's QTH received AND Maidenhead 1 by 2 degree
         square as four-character reference received
</pre>

Entries may include &#8220;general comments&#8221;, and each
log entry may contain club membership of the counter-parting
operator. Logs must be send in electronic form, only the ADIF
format can be accepted. Check your log before sending that all
information required is contained in the file. Logs may be refused
if incomplete and cannot be completed with reasonable effort. Logs
in ADIF format are preferably maintained using the free FISTS
log-converter that has been adapted for this purpose, and that can
be downloaded from the FISTS website as free-ware. This tool,
written and maintained by G3ZOD, generates high quality ADIF logs,
and is the recommended tool for participating in this activity.
