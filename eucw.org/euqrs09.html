Congratulations go to Peter, G3JFS for achieving 1st place in the
QRO section of this years EuCW QRS Party. Closely followed by Martin,
IK2RMZ; and a very worthy 3rd place goes to Rosel, DL2FCA.

The guys from the RU-QRP club who decided to take part this year
deserve a hearty thanks, without them, the class B section would
have been non-existant! So congratulations go to RW3AI, UA1ASB,
and UU7JF respectively for their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place scores.

The "Most Readable Morse" certificate goes to Ray G&Oslash;EML.  With shared
awards presented to G3JFS, IK2RMZ, and DL2FCA.  Congratulations to
all. It's allways a pity each year when nominations are received
for members who did not submit a log, lets hope that next years
EuCW event is better attended, and more will send a log for scrutiny.
