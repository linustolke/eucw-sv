Some comments from the manager:

Sorry for the QRX, some of you sent their logs to the previous manager
DJ2XP and it lasted some time until I finally got them.

Again I have to apologize for the missing results of the EuCW FP 2005. We
tried our best but we could not get neither the final result nor the
logs from DJ2XP, Guenter who fell seriously ill shortly after the 2005
FP. I am very sorry for this inconvenience.

Thanks to all participants who sent in their log entries.

Many participants made their comments about the FP and many of them
complained about the two other contests (LZ Contest, INORC Contest)
which took place at the same time. We are well aware of this situation
and try to find a better solution. Unfortunately almost every weekend
is occupied by some contest. Feel free to make your proposal.

In this moment I can say: we will have a new date for the EuCW
FP 2007. And there will be some major changes in the rules. Of
course you will receive a notice on that as soon as the new
rules are definitive. This information will also be spread
to all EuCW clubs and will be published on the EuCW website
(http://www.eucw.org/root.html).

I look forward to receiving your log of the 2007 EuCW Fraternizing Party.
