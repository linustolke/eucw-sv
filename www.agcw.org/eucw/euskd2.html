<P>The EUCW SKD is not a contest but an event meant to bring out
your old manual straight keys and make a couple of contacts.</P>

<P>EUCW SKD is arranged yearly on the Swedish Midsummer Day, i.e.
the Saturday falling on or between the dates June 20 and
June 26.

<P>Date: Swedish MID-SUMMER DAY (e.g. 23-6-01, 22-6-02, 21-6-03)<BR>
Time: 0800-2200 UTC<BR>
Frequencies: 3540-3580, 7020-7040, 10105-10125 and 14050-14070
kHz.<BR>
Mode: CW, straight key only<BR>
</P>

<P>Scandinavian participants are encouraged to activate 10 and 14
MHz to give the non-Scandinavian stations a better chance to get in
contact with them. It is obligatory for Scandinavian participants
to make at least one QSO with non-Scandinavian stations. Likewise,
it is obligatory for non-Scandinavians to make at least one QSO
with Scandinavia.</P>

<P>As a function of the number of QSOs the participants are
invited to give a "vote" to stations with a particularly good
"handwriting" or "fist".</P>

<P>1-2 QSO: no votes<BR>
3-5 QSO: 1 vote<BR>
6-8 QSO: 2 votes<BR>
9-11 QSO: 3 votes<BR>
More than 12 QSO: 4 votes<BR>
</P>

<P>Do not issue more than one vote per station.</P>

<P>The "Straight Key Award" will be awarded to stations receiving
at least 3 votes.</P>
