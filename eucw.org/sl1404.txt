Snakes & Ladders result for April

Received were 29 logs, containing 1125 valid log entries into 274 square locators

The Snake squares have been determined as follows:
IO92 with 72 log entries
JO02 with 56 log entries
IO83 with 29 log entries

=> Note that these squares cannot be snake in the next two periods of activity
=> Because no one has climbed a ladder in the previous month, no snake bites can happen in April

Of the 274 square locators worked, 113 (!) made it to ladder square with 1 log entry each:

Some participants with fewer QSOs (e.g. DO2TC, M0DAJ) were lucky enough to climb at least one ladder,
whereas others (e.g. G3ZOD, M5ABN) were not so fortunate.

Some reactions from participants:
Dean, M0DAG, writes: First three qso/ragchews ever, may as well use them in S+L too!
MGR=> I could not agree more Dean: these 3 QSOs brought you 30 points!

Chris, EI6KH, writes: It's been great fun so far and has been a big help getting me
back on track after an abscence from CW. I can't remember how many QSO's I need per
month but hopefully 23 is ok. 73 and keep up the good work.
MGR=> The number of log entries is not important. Because of the high non-contest-like
point system, you can get a high score with few QSOs, but you need some luck for that!

Peter, M5ABN, writes: An interesting and enjoyable activity. Nice that you can add to
your score at anytime during the month as and when time allows. Looking forward to the rest of the year.
MGR=> If you miss out on a month of participation: no problem, just come back the next month

Andy, SP9NKI, writes: I guess I got bitten by a snake more than once.
MGR=> Well, this depends on all valid log entries! It is quite impossible to predict whether you'll
hit a snake. The best way to avoid snakes is: make as many QSOs as possible, and try to catch a ladder!

Graham, G3ZOD, writes: I was pleased to take part in the first month of the Snakes and Ladders activity.
MGR=> Well Graham, I hope everybody was as pleased as you were, and I hope to see you all back next month
