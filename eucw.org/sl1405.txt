Snakes & Ladders result for May

Received were 28 logs, containing 1359 valid log entries into 295 square locators. Although one log
less, more valid entries could be recorded into more locators squares!

The Snake squares have been determined as follows:
IO91 with 59 hits
IO93 with 47 hits
JO00 with 30 hits

IO92, JO02 and IO83 received 147, 104 and 33 hits respectively, but because these were already snakes
last month, they will count as normal locators for the month of May.

=> Note that IO83, IO91, IO92, IO93, JO00 and JO02 cannot be snake in the month of June!!!

Of the 295 square locators worked, 119 (!) made it to ladder square with 1 log entry each:

Unfortunately, a few S&L participants had to suffer a snake bite in May, some can be
recognised from the negative scoring. There were others, but their bites were neutralised
because they either managed to climb a ladder at the same time, or they did not climb a ladder in April.

Again there were some nice and encouraging reactions from participants this month. There was one however,
that I would like to share here with you, and that came from Andy, SP9NLI:

"It's okay this game accepts QSOs made with any stations that may come our way on the bands,
but wouldn't it be nice if there were some frequencies and times designated for the participants
to meet other fellow S&L players?"

If anyone wishes to react on Andy's question, then please feel free to do so. S&L is not meant to be a
contest in any way, but if there appears to be a more general need for "arranged contacts within S&L", then
we might have a look into that, either for this or next year's run.

DM4RW mgr S&L
