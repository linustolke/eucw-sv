<PRE>
FISTS CW Club invites all radio amateurs to take part in the annual
EUCW/FISTS QRS Party over five days, Monday-Friday, in April each year.

This is not a contest. Just enjoy plenty of slow Morse activity for a
period of five days. The dates selected are intended to avoid weekend
contest activity. Work any station, including members of EUCW clubs
(see below), but send only in QRS. Standard QSO's with
non-participating stations can be included in logs.

DATES/TIMES: From Monday 23^th April 2007, 0001 UTC, to Friday 27^th
April 2007, 2359 UTC.

MODE: CW only.

POWER: Any authorised power.

CALL: CQ QRS. Stations may be worked once per day, per band.

FREQUENCIES: Recommended areas of activity, +/- 10 kHz of the FISTS
calling frequencies, including WARC bands (see below), but contacts can
be made on any frequency. Non-QRP stations should avoid calling CQ on
the popular QRP frequencies (see below).

KEYS/SPEEDS: Use any type of key or keyer. No keyboard sending or
pre-programmed messages from computers or keyers, but pre-programmed CQ
calls or CQ loops are permitted. Maximum speed 14 words per minute (70
cpm). The speed of a QSO should be at the speed of the slower station.

CONTACTS: Normal friendly QSOs, no special requirements. QSOs with any
station count. Work any station in any country, including stations not
taking part in the QRS Party but try to persuade them to work QRS.

LOGS/FEEDBACK: This is not a contest, but logs and feedback will be
welcomed in the following classes:

A - More than 10w input or 5w output power

B - QRP (10w input or 5w output, or less)

C - Shortwave listeners.

Logs should show Date, Time, Callsign, Name, QTH and EUCW Club/Number
(if appropriate) of the stations worked/heard, and may include up to
three votes for "Most Readable Morse Heard" (one vote per station).

AWARDS:

a) A certificate will be awarded to the three participants
working/hearing the most stations in each class.

b) Certificates of Merit will be awarded to the three operators
receiving most votes for the "Most Readable Morse Heard", provided the
operators nominated have also submitted a log. If the operators
receiving the most votes have not submitted a log the certificates of
merit will be awarded to the qualifying operators with the next highest
number of votes. In the event of a tie in first, second or third
places, multiple certificates will be awarded, marked "Shared Award".
