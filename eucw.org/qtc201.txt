EuCW Bulletin No 2020/01
=======================

1) Covid-19
Dear friends, I am writing to you after a few months of silence due to the
very difficult situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic virus which, as
you know, has heavily affected, in particular, Northern Italy and especially
the city of Bergamo where I live with my family. We have gone through very
difficult moments and some of you have written to me telling that you have
had to face very serious problems, both family and professional. I hope that
you are all healthy and safe and I invite you not to let your guard down,
in view of the Autumn period: it is not finished yet. I hope to hear from
you soon and that you can take part in to the initiatives of our Club.

2) IARU Region 1 General Conference

As you know, the IARU Region 1 General Conference will be in Novi Sad, Serbia
by virtual means and it is starting in a few months (October 10 – 2020,
October 16, 2020). In the light of the COVID-19 problems, General Conference
will be divided in two parts.

The first part will be held on the scheduled dates by virtual means and the
second part in-person in Novi Sad on a date to be determined in 2021. The
11 – 15 October 2020event will consider much of the “business as
usual” elements of a General Conference in Committees C2, C3, C4, C5 and
C7. We received the IARU “news” that you can read on official IARU web site:
“Because frequency allocations and amateur radio operating interests vary
in different parts of the world, the development of band plans – voluntary
guidelines on the use of the spectrum that is available to radio amateurs
– is a responsibility of the three IARU regional organizations. Each of
the three Regions has a band planning committee to focus on this work. In
recent years there have been increased efforts to bring the regional band
plans into alignment wherever possible. Final approval of band plan revisions
is generally given by the regional conferences of IARU member-societies that
are held every three years on a rotating basis. This approach to band planning
generally has kept pace with the evolution of amateur radio operating. However,
the explosive growth in HF (below 30 MHz) digital modes, particularly FT8, has
led to perceived overcrowding of HF digital mode band segments. Accordingly,
a working group has been formed consisting of representatives of the three
regional band planning committees. This is the first time the three Regions
have joined together to directly coordinate band planning efforts. The working
group has already had fruitful discussions with the WSJT Development Group
led by Joe Taylor, K1JT.Additional discussions, including with other HF
stakeholders, will be held as part of a fundamental review of the different
HF digital modes, and how they can be best categorized and arranged to share
the limited spectrum available. The main aim is to develop solutions that
reduce congestion within very popular mode segments while preventing mutual
interference between incompatible modes to the greatest extent possible. While
the proposed band plan revisions will have to be approved by member-societies
in each Region, recent administrative changes mean that the changes can be
implemented without having to wait for the regional conferences”.

You are all invited, in view of the Conference, to send us any proposals or opinions, with particular regard to the question relating to the frequency segments to be assigned or confirmed to the cw mode. Every proposal, comment or suggestion will be greatly appreciated.
