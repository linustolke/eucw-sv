<h1>Status of the Swedish translation</h1>

<p>
  Pages with dates are when the translation was done or updated to
  match the original page.  Pages without dates are not translated.
</p>

<p>
  The order is firstly the not translated, and after that, sorted
  after date with the oldest first.
</p>

<p>
  Within each "date", it is sorted by priority, started with the
  highest priority and then lower. The pages without priority are
  listed last.
</p>
<ol>
  {% assign sorted = site.pages |
     where_exp: "item", "item.url != '/se-translation-status.html'" |
     where_exp: "item", "item.url != '/assets/css/style.css'" |
     reverse | sort: 'priority' |
     reverse | sort: 'translated' %}
  {% for p in sorted %}
    {% assign url = p.url | replace_first: "/", "" %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ url }}">{{ p.title }} {{ url }}</a> {{ p.priority }} {{ p.translated }}
    </li>
