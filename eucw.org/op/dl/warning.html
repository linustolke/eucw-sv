<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p>do not use this template unless you have at least a moderate
reading skill of German. If you do not speak German at all and if
you want to show sympathy for German culture you may end your qso
with a formula like 'awdh'. But this should be done at the END of
the qso because the start of the QSO is to be considered as a
negotiation of the language to use. The default choice is
<b>Basic</b> English.</p>
<p>The strongest element of this negotiation is the prefix. A DL or
OE station may be talked to in German by default, a station outside
the German speaking areas definitely not.</p>
<p>If your intention is to use German and if you have a different
prefix you should manifest this intention as clearly as possible
and as early as possible.</p>
<p>However, it is not recommended to pretend a language skill which
you don't have. Text elements from a ham compendium are not enough
to try a QSO in German. At best they are a help for foreign
speakers of German to learn about some specific terms.</p>
<p>What if your language negotiation fails?<br>
Considerate German speaking operators will support you if you are
studying the language, others probably won't, some may even be hard
to convince to come back in German. Usually this is because your
qso partner has a poor copy or may be using a decoder which is
operating too close to the decoding threshold. Other reasons may be
the use of macros written in English. In extremely rare cases it is
the vanity to expose a brilliant English and almost never it is the
implicit idea that your German is too bad to be usable. Don't be
discouraged. CW is a great method to practice a foreign language.
You do not have to struggle with accents or pronounciation and you
can use it while you language skill is still basic. Be ready to
accept that a good share of DLs will ignore your German if you try
to use it. But most German speakers will appreciate your effort and
praise you tacitly or openly.</p>
