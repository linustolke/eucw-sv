Subtractions:

-1   penalty if a call book detail
     is logged while on-air detail
     is different. 
Comment:
(*) AGCW Club stations (excluded from individual ranking)

Penalties: Only two penalties were given. Two individuals logged a club
station and missed its location. This would have cost them a 0.2 pt
reduction. However, these guys looked up this club station and found
the trustee's data, of course. The station QTH and the trustee QTH were
475 km apart. The penalty was 1.0 pt. Luckily, these guys did copy the
operator's name correctly, otherwise, the penalty would have been 2
points.

Good News: The number of non-plausible entries for names and location
stopped rising. These are often caused by autofills in certain logging
software. If you log Stutgart instead of Stuttgart the reduction will
be 0.2. If you write "67460 Souffelweyersheim (Bas-Rhin)" the loss
will be the same because it is not plausible that anyone will tell
you the postal code on air, especially if all others copied "QTH NR
STRASBURG". Of course, variants like "NR STRASBOURG", "NR STRASSBURG"
are acceptable, as well. Please check your ADIF files in order to avoid
non-plausible data. Likewise, a name like "Prof. Dr. rer. nat. S.
Cleverle" will be considered non-plausible. A little guesswork is OK
but do not trust c/s directories, especially not if it's a club station
like dl0bb, f6kph, gx0ipx, gs0ayr, ha7klj, iq3ed, oe9xrv, oh6ad, ok1kfb,
pi4srs, rk3nwa, sp3pgz, .... Stay safe and log only what you hear on air
or have the courage to omit what you miss. If an item is garbled because
ADIF does not tolerate accents or umlauts you will not suffer any point
loss.

MRM 
===
DJ6UX   20   MRM Award


Soapbox: There were few comments, most were personal, some explained why
they had little time, others made reference to poor condx, again others
told that it is very hard to nominate candidates for MRM. It's true but
we keep it as a tradition, and we congratulate OE6GWG for his excellent
achievement in several classes. His results show that even a QRP station
can play an important role in the QRS-Week.

The club winners have more in store for those who like slow Morse code,
weekly meetings on 80m
