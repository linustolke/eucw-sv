enthusiasts.</p>
</h2>
<p>First Austrian Telegraphy Interest Group, would like to
introduce itself</p>
<p>Morse telegraphy is the oldest and most traditional form of long
distance communication but regrettably the era of CW has come to an
end in the field of commercial as well as naval radio services.</p>
<p>If thousands of radio amateurs all over the world still make use
of their key, it is not due to nostalgic enthusiasm alone but
because telegraphy, as is universally acknowledged, enables global
communication by use of simple means even under unfavourable
conditions.</p>
<p>To provide a homestead for all radio amateurs who are willing to
make use of their key at least once in a while or - even better -
to give preference to telegraphic communication in general, there
are 2 groups in Austria</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>a specific section for telegraphy within the Radio Society of
Austria &shy; &Ouml;VSV, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the OE-CW-Group.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The section for telegraphy within the &Ouml;VSV is a technical
section, has no specific members but represents all telegraphers of
all members of the society.</p>
<p>The OE-CW-Group is open for all interested persons from Austria
as well as abroad whose objectives are to promote the improvement
of telegraphy techniques and encourage the use of CW thereby
attempting to establish contacts and create friendship between
radio amateurs all over the world.</p>
<p>To all who want to join our club, the simple application
procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>Please send informal application for membership in the
OE-CW-G</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the use of CW on the bands add copies of 20 QSL
cards confirming contacts in telegraphy or an appropriate GCR
list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One valid contact (QSO) on one of the QTCs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To cover printing and mailing costs please add 10 (membership is
lifelong, no further charges are collected)</p>
</li>
</ol>
