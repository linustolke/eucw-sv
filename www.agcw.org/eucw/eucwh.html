<h2> Other Events in EUCW</h2>

<dl>
<dt> 1978</dt>

<dd>SCAG took the first initiative. Statutes were proposed on
1978.06.27 (These statutes are re-printed in SCAG-NL #50 from April
1978). According to these statutes only clubs with at least 100
individual members could be members. The leadership of EUCW should
rotate on a yearly base.</dd>

<dt> 1979</dt>

<dd>EUCW founded officially.</dd>

<dt> 1986</dt>

<dd>CWC (HB9) deleted on 1986.02.15. SCAG leadership proposes
withdrawal of SCAG from EUCW (1986.03.01), to be decided by the
annual assembly. 1986.05.31: SCAG Assembly in Copenhagen postpones
decision about EUCW withdrawal. DL6MK encounters difficulties to
find a new EUCW president. TOPS, SARS, HCC, INORC could not take
over presidency. UFT proposes a EUCW award.</dd>

<dt> 1987</dt>

<dd>DJ2XP takes over the Fraternizing Party. The FP date changes
from June to late November. 1987.04.25: SCAG assembly in T&auml;by
gives up plans for withdrawal from EUCW.</dd>

<dt> 1988</dt>

<dd>Novice award of GQRP gets the status of an official EUCW
activity. EUCW Net (80 m QTC net) operative since September.</dd>

<dt> 1990</dt>

<dd>TOPS withdraws from membership because of a lack of activity
(1990.07.01), the option to re-join remains open. Fraternal links
to non-European clubs established: QRP-ARCI (W/K) and GPCW (PY).
The SCAG Straight Key Day on New Year's Day becomes an official
EUCW activity.</dd>

<dt> 1991</dt>

<dd>
Worked EUCW Award created (1991.04.27) to commemorate the 200th
anniversary of the birth of Samuel F.B. Morse. HCC (Spain) generously met
the cost of printing the certificates (in the UK), which were designed by
G4FAI. First award winner: DK9EA (1991.09.30). Generous donations received
from other clubs were reserved for use on future EUCW special projects.
CWAS (PY) associates as another overseas guest. It takes over the tasks
of GPCW (PY).
</dd>

<dt> 1992</dt>

<dd>Membership rules were modified in order to open EUCW for small
clubs. The decision was taken by mail vote. 18 clubs were invited
to vote, 13 were in favor of the change, 1 disagreed, 1 agreed
conditionally, 3 clubs did not respond.</dd>

<dt> 1993</dt>

<dd>SLDXC (Saar-Lorraine DX club) applied for membership but was
vetoed down for being rather a DX club than a CW club. Well-defined
membership application policy established, all non-CW clubs and all
non-European clubs will be excluded from the application
procedures. QRP clubs will remain an exception because QRP is
inherently linked to CW. The Fraternizing Party gets an extra
sponsorship from EA3DOS who donates miniature ("Lilliput") keys to
winners.</dd>

<dt> 1994</dt>

<dd>New statutes were adopted. Changes include: Clubs with at least
100 individual members will have FULL (i.e. voting) membership.
Clubs with 5 to 99 members will have RESTRICTED (i.e. non-voting)
membership. The term of office of chairmen is 3 years.</dd>

<dt> 2000</dt>

<dd>Membership application from CW-C-UFRC (Belgium) published in
EUCW Bulletin 2000/2. Likewise the GACW from Argentina offered
co-operation with EUCW. Proposal for a new constitution.</dd>
 
<dt> 2001</dt>
 
<dd> CW-C-UFRC (Belgium) changed name to CFT. FISTS donates a EUCW QRS
Week as new EUCW activity. First QRS Week held in April 2001. UFT
dedicates a 160m contest to EUCW.</dd>

<dt> 2002</dt>
 
<dd> Professional Radio Operators CW Club International from Romania
applied membership but was vetoed down. 
</dd>

<dt> 2006</dt>

<dd>DJ2XP retired from his post as EUCW AWARD and Fraternizing Party
manager. These jobs are taken over by DK7VW. Unfortunately, the results
of the 2005 Frat Party got lost in the takeover procedure.</dd>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>This list is based on my AGCW-Info and SCAG-NL archives from the
80ies and my EUCW Bulletin archive (starting 1991). Several friends
helped to improve my data (see acknowledgments below). Yet, this
list is incomplete and may contain errors. Please send corrections
or additional infos to:...eucw (at) agcw.de... Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>(*) ON5ME donations covered the running costs of the presidency at
100% during his term of office, i.e. official EUCW assets have
only been used to cover running costs of other EUCW officers. Thanks
Oscar.</p>
