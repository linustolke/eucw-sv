EuCW Bulletin No 2025/01
=======================

1) A Happy New CW Year 2025 to all of you. A second time in a row unfortunately a somewhat delayed bulletin from my side. Your Chairman is now stationed in the city of Quozhou, in the Zhejiang province, 400 km south of Shanghai. I have tested my remote connection to SM6LRR in Sweden, but unfortunately bad news. The ping times are close to 300 ms and the maximum should be around 200 ms. This will mean that my CW activity in the next year or two, most likely will be quite low. Anyway, I have applied for (and received) a Chinese Amateur Radio Guest License. This does not mean I can operate my own station, but I will be able to operate from Chinese club stations. We will see if I manage to get time to visit any stations in the year to come. My work schedule is very busy and this newsletter is being composed from TA (Turkey) after visiting EP (Iran). Next countries planned are CE, CP and YB.

2. The Marconi Club ARI Loano organized "Qso Party Day" / 7th edition, always with formula of “Short Contest” This year, the event date was January 4th 2025 from 07:00 utc to 21:00 utc on CW 20-40-80 mt . The aims is to make our Club known to the new generations of CW operators, and bring together all those who truly love and believe in telegraphy. During the event will be involved all members of the historic Club, which today counts almost 1000 Members from more than 60 countries divided in two categories., Members and Independent non-members. The log will be accepted only in Cabrillo format and should be uploaded on the website of Marconi Club. Rules, results and online awards could be downloaded after the contest at https://www.marconiclub.it Thanks to Tony IK1QBT

3) The Hungarian CW Group HACWG was founded in 1985 with 10 founding members. Now there are more than 250 members. They celebrate their 40th birthday this year. On this occasion they plan to activate the HG40CW callsign probably for a month. Details will be worked out later. When it starts you will find HG40CW on the clusters. Thanks Lacy HA3NU

4) The GQRP Club was busy during the festive season with the Winter Sports, an on-air get-togehter event focused on friendly and conversational QSOs that happens between Boxing Day and New Year's Day, both included. The event saw the partecipation of many club memebrs from the UK and from abroad. The Club will have another major activity around Easter, and then will get ready for International QRP Days on the 17th of June, followed by the Summer Sizzler. Check the Club website for more

5) In December NTC has organised the last QSO party of the year with a total of about 50 participants. This was one of the themed QSO parties celebrating the name day of Saint Nicholas, PF6SINT being one of the bonus station. Carel PA0CMU has won the 2024 series in the electronic keying section and Lothar DL1DXL in the mechanical keying section. In 2025 we will have our log checker in place so people can upload their logs to the website at https://www.pi4ntc.nl. You are all invited to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Netherlands Telegraphy Club on January 31, rules are at https://pi4ntc.nl/ntcap. The first 3 NTC QSO parties of 2025 will take place on January 16, February 20 and March 20 (every third Thursday of the month). Thanks Joop PG4I

6) The Very High Speed Club has a new secretary/treasurer: Jo PG4I. He was installed as a member of the VHSC board on August 15, 2024. After our previous secretary PA0DIN became silent key all member certificates were lost. We are now in the process of printing new ones. New members can choose to receive a digital version at no cost or a printed, signed version for a small fee covering our postage costs. Rules for joining the VHSC can be found at https://www.morsecode.nl/vhsc%20club.html. In 2024 we have welcomed 5 new members: DF7TV, DL5DXS, EA6EJ, EA6BF and EA4BB. They have all shown to be capable of sending and receiving Morse code at 40 words per minute by making 4 QSO’s with a length of 30 minutes with their VHSC sponsors.

At our request the Dutch Authority for Digital Infrastructure (www.rdi.nl) assigned our association the callsign PI4VHC. At the QRZ.com page of PI4VHC you can find a short history of our club.


REQUEST FOR BETTER CONTRIBUTION

The January 2025 bulletin this time is unfortunately VERY thin. My own busy schedule and virtually zero CW activity on the bands does not help either. So if you feel that this Newsletter needs to be longer next time, please already now compose your contribution for the next April Newsletter.

My Chairman role is soon expiring and I have promised to make a CAREFUL review of which member clubs we can consider ACTIVE and which can be considered INACTIVE. Zero contribution to this newsletter during my past 2-3 years, I consider inactivity. 

So if you would like to save your club from being on the monitoring for membership evaluation, please take this sentence seriously. It is not possible to be a member club in EuCW if it not even one contribution to the newsletter has been made in several years, agree?

We have a few more newsletters edited by me, so save your club in EuCw by contributing to the next newsletters please.
