Snakes & Ladders version 1, final results

It is with pleasure that I can now present to you the final result of the first
run of EuCW's Snakes & Ladders. We had a total number of participants of 47,
some only filed a single log, others participated every month!

The results listed below, include for every participant the end-score, the rank,
the number of QRAs worked, the number of QSOs made, the number of logs filed,
whether the draw for the second Begali key was entered, and whether a
certificate will be granted, with or without the endorsement for 12 logs filed,
the latter marked with an asterix.

The rank is firstly based on points deserved, subsequently on the number of QRAs
worked, and finally on the number of QSOs made.

If you would like to know right away, who won the two Begali keys, then look
directly under the tabulated results, where the proud winners of these fine keys
are announced.

Based on the pointing system for this first version, the three potential winners
of the first Begali key are G4LHI (Peter), OH7QR (Erkki) and RW3AI (Valery), all
with 720 points. As explained, if there is no clear winner based on points, then
first the total number of QRAs worked shall be looked at, and then the number of
QSOs. For said three participants, these numbers are as follows:

G4LHI: 720 points; QRAs worked: 273; QSOs made: 1751
OH7QR: 720 points; QRAs worked: 242; QSOs made: 970
RW3AI: 720 points; QRAs worked: 236; QSOs made: 662

This means that the first Begali key goes to Peter, G4LHI, with 720 points and
the highest number of 273 locator squares worked over the full period of 12
months. Congratulations G4LHI, Peter!

The second Begali is to be given to a participant who filed at least 10 logs
over the 12 month period of S&Lv1. There were 21 participants fulfilling this
requirement, excluding Peter, G4LHI, who already won the first Begali key, and
Martin, IK2RMZ, who is part of the organising team. Listed alphabetically by
call-sign and numbered respectively, the participants in the draw are:

         1. 2E0DPH, Phil
         2. DH0DK, Ben
         3. DK5OE, Klaus
         4. DL1DXL, Lothar
         5. DL7UGN, Mike
         6. DO1UZ, Olaf
         7. DO2TC, Peter
         8. EI6KH, Chris
         9. G3YJQ, Fred
        10. G4KLE, Merv
        11. GM0EPO, John
        12. IK5WOB, Fabrizio
        13. M0DRK, Derek
        14. M5ABN, Pete
        15. OE3LHB, Heinz
        16. OH7QR, Erkki
        17. OK2BMA, Pavel
        18. PA0ATG, Adriaan
        19. PA0DIN, Din
        20. RW3AI, Valery
        21. SP9NLI, Andy

To determine the winner of the second key, EuCW's ECMs have been asked to send
in a number between 1 and 100, without knowing the list above in advance. All
numbers received have been added and the resulting sum has been divided by 21.
The result of this division can be expressed as an integer number (the truncated
result of the division) with a remainder between 0 and 20. The winner of the
second key is the participant who's number corresponds to said remainder plus 1,
so as to obtain a number between 1 and 21.

The numbers received from the 9 ECMs that replied were: 5, 21, 21, 32, 37, 64,
75, 77 and 80. This adds up to a total of 412. Divided by 21, this gives a
truncated result of 19, with a remainder of 13. Plus 1, means that number 14 in
the list is the winner of the second key. So also M5ABN, Pete: congratulations!

This finalises the first run of Snakes & Ladders. I hope you enjoyed it as much
as I did, and I look forward to receiving your logs for Snakes and Ladders
version 2.

Good luck to you all, best 73s,
Robert, DM4RW (mgr S&L)
