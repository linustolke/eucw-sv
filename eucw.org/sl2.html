<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this activity is to try to collect as many points, by
working as many Maidenhead locator squares as possible, helped or
hindered by ladder and snake squares respectively. A ladder square
means a bonus is awarded for a rarely worked locator square, an
often-worked snake square means a penalty is given. Conditions are
that QSOs must take at least five minutes, and stations must be
European stations. Please QRS when needed, this activity should be
equally accessible for all. Note that this is an activity and not a
contest. There are 9 operating periods of a full month each, from
April 1st till December 31, 2015.</p>

<h2>Stations to work</h2>
<p>Stations to be contacted are all stations in Europe as defined for
this activity (see list in the appendix), except stations working
Maritime Mobile (/ MM) in international waters.</p>

<h2>Operating frequencies</h2>
<p>Contacts shall be made in the dedicated CW sections of all amateur
bands from 160m to 2m (60m and 4m excluded). For the purpose of
S&amp;L, said sections are split into a "lower" and an "upper"
portion, the latter being formed by the upper 10 kHz of the
dedicated CW section as follows: 160m: 1.828 - 1.838 MHz 80m: 3.570
- 3.580 MHz 40m: 7.030 - 7.040 MHz 30m: 10.130 - 10.140 MHz 20m:
14.060 - 14.070 MHz 17m: 18.085 - 18.095 MHz 15m: 21.060 - 21.070
MHz 12m: 24.905 - 24.915 MHz 10m: 28.060 - 28.070 MHz 6m: 50.090 -
50.100 MHz 2m: 144.100 - 144.110 MHz For locator squares worked in
an "upper" portion, double points shall be a warded, so as to
stimulate the population of these regions. QRP calling frequencies
must be avoided by non-QRP operators. Further note that 144.100 MHz
is the "Random Meteor Scatter" frequency, and should be avoided.
Contacts made must be CW and point-to-point. Contacts made through
repeaters and satellites, as well as netted QSOs, are excluded.</p>

<h2>Ladder, normal and snake squares</h2>
<p>All logs received in a monthly period of activity, will be merged
by the activity manager into a monthly "master log". Locator
squares only appearing once in this master log, shall be ladder
squares. Locator squares appearing more than 5 times in the master
log, shall be candidate snake squares. For every 10 candidate snake
squares, one snake square shall be selected from the candidate
snake squares using a seeded random function. Locator squares that
are neither ladder square, nor snake square, shall be normal
squares.</p>

<h2>Points</h2>
<p>A participant's score is determined by checking the locator squares
worked by the participant against the ladder, normal and snake
squares. This task is performed by the activity manager (using
software). For each unique ladder square worked, 4 points shall be
awarded. For each unique normal square worked, 2 points shall be
awarded. For each unique snake square worked, a penalty of 4 points
shall be given. A participant cannot have more snakes than ladders
(a negative score is therefore impossible). </p><p>In the upper portions
of the CW band-section, points awarded for ladder and normal
squares shall be doubled. The penalty given for a snake square
shall, however, not be doubled. Over the mark of 100 points,
additional points and penalties shall only be counted half. If a
normal square is worked in both lower and higher portion of a
dedicated CW band-section, only the contact in the higher portion
shall be accounted for.</p>

<h2>Log requirements</h2>
<p>Electronic logs may be submitted for each operating period. Logs in
".adi" format must be received by the Activity Manager by email
(SL(at)eucw.org) before the eighth day of the month that follows
the period of operation being recorded. Late filed logs may be
refused. Each log must contain as header:</p>

When submitting the log, the following should be indicated:

<ol><li>period of activity</li>

<li>call sign(s) used on air</li>

<li>the operator's name and email</li></ol>

<p>All entries in the .adi log must include:</p>

<ul><li>date and both on and off times in UTC

    QSOs without any of these values shall be deemed invalid. 
    If no Off date is given, the Off date is presumed to be the
    same as the On date. However, where a QSO took place overnight,
    also the Off date should be given in order to establish a
    correct QSO duration.

    The duration of each QSO will be calculated based on On and Off 
    times, as well as On and Off dates where applicable. Any
    QSO shorter than five minutes shall be deemed invalid. The
    calculation shall be based on hours and minutes, seconds are
    ignored.

    Decisive for the month a QSO shall be recorded to, is the On date.</li>

<li>frequency in MHz. Note that for this activity, only QSOs made in
    the dedicated CW band-sections of the amateur bands allowed shall
    be recorded. QSOs made outside of the dedicated CW band-sections
    shall be deemed invalid.</li>

 <li>call-sign of the station contacted

    If the call-sign is missing, the QSO shall be deemed invalid.</li>

 <li>signal report sent and received

    If one or both of "RST sent" or "RST received" is missing,
    the QSO shall be deemed invalid.</li>

 <li>operator's name of the contacted station

    If the name is missing, the QSO shall be deemed invalid.</li>

 <li>Mode

    Mode must be "CW". If no or another mode is specified, the QSO
    shall be deemed invalid.</li>

 <li>QTH and Maidenhead 1o by 2o locator square as four-character 
    reference

    Both four-character and six-character Maidenhead locator
    references can be processed. They will be compared to a list with
    Maidenhead square locators that cover the European countries as
    specified in the appendix. If a QSO is claimed with a locator
    that is not in the list, the activity manager shall perform
    a manual check concerning the validity of the QSO. Whenever
    needed and required, the list shall be updated. Otherwise shall
    the QSO be deemed invalid.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that essential information is exchanged over
the air. Information not exchanged must be completed otherwise,
the burden for this remains with the participant. Invalid QSO
entries will be ignored for processing, of which the participant
shall be informed. Logs must be sent in electronic form; only logs
in compliance with the ADIF specification will be accepted. Logs
submitted in Excel, clear-text or any other format including
home-brew file formats with file names ending on ".adi" will be
refused. In order to allow automatic processing, compliance with the
ADIF specification is a necessity. Any amateur radio log-book program
is capable of producing such ADIF compliance log files.  Logs shall
be processed electronically within a maximum of a week, and the
results for a period of activity shall be ultimately published on
the 14th of the month following the period of activity. In case
this deadline cannot be met, all participants will be informed.</p>

<h2>Awards</h2> <p>A certificate will be awarded to every entrant who
submits six or more valid logs to the activity and an endorsement
will be added to the certificate for those who submit a valid log for
every one of the nine operating periods. Call-signs of participants
who have earned 1st award, 2nd award and 3rd award, will be
published after the end of the activity, but before February 1st, 
2016, as part of a list of all participants and their points
earned.  </p>

<h2>Notes</h2> <p>Decisions made by the Activity Manger will be
final and no correspondence will be entered into.  </p>

<h2>Appendix 1:
Definition of Europe.</h2> <p>European countries (based on ARRL
DXCC List, January 2013, with numeric codes and ordered by main
prefix). European countries include all sovereign states recognized
by the United Nations in the continental European land mass and also

<h2>Appendix 2: about "Snakes and Ladders" and its
origin</h2> 

<p>
Snakes and Ladders is a game that originated in India and
arrived in the United Kingdom well over a hundred years ago. It is
a classic board game, wherein the board is divided into 100 squares
or fields. It has been popular in USA where it is known as Chutes and
Ladders as well as Snakes and Ladders. Variants of the game are known
in other countries, for example, in the southern German speaking
countries: "Leiterspiel" (ladder game), and in northern Germany:
"Pferderennen" (horse racing), and in the Netherlands: "Ganzenbord"
or in Italy "gioco dell'oca" (goose board), etc. 

<P>
The object of the
game (and its variants) is to navigate one's game piece, according to
dice tosses, from the start-field to the finish or end-field, helped
or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively. Ladders progress a
player towards the finish, snakes regress him towards the start. 
<P>

The
way from start- to end-field may be seen as a reflection of life. On
each player's turn, the game-piece is moved forward based on the
number of eyes scored by tossing one or two dices. When doing so,
the player may end up on a field that brings him either good luck
(ladder) or bad luck (snake). Good luck means that he receives
a bonus, and that he may forward his game-piece over a number of
fields higher than he scored with the dices. Bad luck means that he
has to move his game-piece back towards the start a number of fields,
or that he is stuck for some time to a certain field (for example,
in the Dutch goose game, the goose may fall in a well, only to be
liberated by another goose passing by; or the goose may end up behind
bars, meaning a player has to skip a number of turns before he may
proceed further). 

<P>
In our version of the game the board is made up
from the map of the continent of Europe, and the individual squares
are the locator squares on the map. This means we have a game board
that is roughly over 2000 fields large. Contrary to the board game
(where a player needs an undetermined number of dice roles or turns
in order to get from start- to end-field), there are no start- and
end-fields defined. Instead may each player put down his game-piece
on any field by claiming a radio contact, QSO, with that particular
field. There is no limitation to the number of fields he may put
his game piece on, or on how often he may put his game-piece on
a certain field. In fact, the more, the better. 


<p>Each player gets
exactly twelve turns, each turn being represented by a calendar
month of activity. After the end of each month, it is recorded
which fields were visited by each player, and how often.  
</p>
    <ul><li>The fields that were visited by all players, and how often
    these fields were visited by all players, is information used
    for determining which fields become either snake or ladder,
    or just normal fields.</li>

    <li>The fields that were visited by each individual player, is
    information used for determining a player's reward for each
    month of activity.</li></ul>

<p>The ladders are sorted from the fields visited by all players. It
are those fields for which only one QSO is claimed by all players
together. This means that only one player claimed a QSO with that
field, and he will therefore "climb a ladder", i.e. receive a
bonus. </p>

<P>
The snakes are also sorted from the fields visited by all players. In
addition, it is taken into account how often a field was visited by
all players together. A snake can be a field for which more than
five QSOs are claimed. Which of the fields with more than five
QSOs become snake, is determined using a seeded random function,
wherein the seed cannot be anticipated, yet delivers reproducible
results (seed = N* #QSOs(all), wherein N is the period of activity
for each month. For each ten fields with more than five QSOs, one
field shall become snake. Fields that are neither ladder, nor snake,
shall be referred to as normal squares.

<P>
Once ladder, normal and snake fields have been determined, a
player's reward can be determined by simply comparing a player's
fields to the lists of ladder, normal and snake fields. How often a
player visited a field, is irrelevant and not taken into account.
