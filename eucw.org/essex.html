<b> Essex CW Club:</b></A> 
<BR>
CW club from the UK. The home page of the clubs writes:
<p>
In November 2009, a small group of CW enthusiasts decided to form a
specialist group for those with a common interest in maintaining and
promoting the use of Morse code on the Amateur Radio bands.  The intention
is to facilitate a number of CW events and bring together those skilled in
Morse code across traditional radio clubs. This will form a critical mass
of otherwise dispersed practitioners and promote use of the mode within
the hobby.
<p>
We are affiliated to the RSGB.
<p>
The club callsigns are GX1FCW and G8CW.
Our special short contest callsign is G4C.
