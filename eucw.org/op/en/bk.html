<h1 id="bk--...-.--break-and-qsk">BK -...-.- Break and QSK</h1>
<p>Break-in or QSK is an operational mode that requires particular
hardware enabling its user to listen while transmitting Morse code. The
receiver is open in the pauses between the dashes and dots of a Morse
letter. This requires either a fast transmit/receive switch or a separate
receiver with a separated receiving antenna sufficiently isolated from the
transmit antenna.</p>
<p>If it is possible to have an open receiver only in the pauses between
letters, we speak of semi bk or semi QSK.</p>
<p>Full break-in traffic is one of the most advanced uses of CW, in the
old times (when RX and TX used to be separated) it was pretty common. With
the upcoming commercial rigs in the 60ies and 70ies the use of QSK dropped
a lot. Yet, high-end transceivers may have useful QSK. Progress in
electronics made QSK more affordable, yet, only a few operators do use it
all the time. Those who do are convinced that QSL operation is the best
what you can get out of CW.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-use-of-bk">alternative use of BK</h2>
<p>a final BK often means something like "back to you, but please do not
bother to repeat the call signs now". It is meant to ask the qso partner a
quick question. With this meaning it is usually given as -... -.- with the
space between B and K.</p>
<p>Yet, the literal meaning of bk is that the op is fit to operate in QSK
mode.</p>
