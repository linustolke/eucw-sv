<h2>Essex CW ARC Bootcamp and Convention 19th October 2019
</h2>
Now in our 3rd year, Essex CW is again hosting the 2019 CW Bootcamp
and Convention. We have already had interest from around the
U.K. and across the water from The Netherlands.
<p>
Places for the bootcamp and convention to be held in Witham Essex
are filling up. If you have interest in attending this years event
and to avoid disappointment, contact Andy G0IBN at 
g0ibn1 [@-symbol] yahoo.com
