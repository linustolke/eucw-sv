<h1 id="name-for-cw">Name for CW</h1>
<p>Should I choose a particular name or 'handle' for CW traffic? The
answer to this question is 'it depends'. The following points may be worth
considering.
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first and most straightforward name is simply the name that you are
used to from relatives and friends. Even if it is a little longer you will
not suffer any disadvantages. If you use e.g. 'Thomas' instead of Tom you
will not really loose a lot of time. After all it's a hobby and nobody
counts the split seconds. If you have a radio name for other modes, just
use it for CW, too, for the sake of remaining consistent.
<li>
<p>It is an advantage if your name matches your call sign. However, by now
it is not uncommon that names reflect an ethnic background and not a
living place. In this case it may be an advantage to expose such a
'foreign' name because the qso partner might be happy to use the language
that the name points to.
<li>
<p>It is an advantage to be consistent and not use many names at the same
time. A common deviation from this general idea is to have a local name to
be used for co-nationals and an international name. This makes sense if
you feel your name sounds too exotic for international use. If you make up
a radio name, be sure to check the Internet in order to find out whether
or not your handle is not loaded with negative meanings or with misleading
associations.
<li>
<p>If you have the bad luck that your name uses special accented
characters, dieresis, umlauts and such international partners should not
be challenged with special morse code chars like --.--, .--.-, ..--, or
such. A near-Ascii representations makes sense in this case.</ul>
