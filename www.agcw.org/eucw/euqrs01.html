RESULTS AND REPORT OF THE EUCW/FISTS QRS PARTY.
22nd-28th APRIL 2001
<P>
In spite of a low number of logs being received this inaugural running of
the EUCW/FISTS QRS Party seemed to be enjoyed by most of the participating
stations.  It was clear from the logs that a lot more people took part in
the event than sent in logs.
<P>
The really good thing to come out from the logs was that several entries
were received from people who had not entered any form of event before,
including the winner of the "Most Readable Morse" certificate.
The key/keyers used were many and varied from a Schurr squeeze paddle to a
Swedish brass pump key and a G4ZPY key (presented as "Fist of the Year" in
1996).  This last key was used by G8NT who I believe was the oldest
contestant, at 91 years 8 months old, who finished runner up in Class A. 
The power used in Class A varied from 100W to 5W so nobody needed to run a
lot of power.  Logs were received from 5 different EUCW clubs, but it was
notable from comments made in the logs that a lot of people were hoping to
hear from more of the mainland European clubs. One or two rule changes
have been suggested and these will be considered in time for next year's
contest.
<P>
Congratulations to all the certificate winners and especially to G4KXG for
being voted "Most Readable Morse Heard" during the party.  Many thanks to
all whom sent in logs and hopefully we will have more participation in
next year's event, which starts on 28th April 2002.
