IZ2FME
EuCW Chairman

EuCW Bulletin No 2019/August
============================

1) Thank you all for my election to the EuCW Chairman (de IZ2FME).
First of all, I'd like to thank Alex I5SKK (and all the EuCW
Board) for the great work he / they made during the last years;
it's very useful not only for our EuCW activities, but also for
the CW world in general. Thank you, Alex also for what you wrote
about me: I didn't expect to be elected as the EuCW Chairman,
and I'll do my best.

2) What we think we could do for the EuCW Club.

2.1) Articles about the EuCW Club.

As Alex I5SKK already told you in his last Bullettin, I wrote
a short article for RR (Radiorivista - ARI Italian magazine
- sept. edition), about our Club, its origins, its purposes,
its activities and rules (also concerning the Snake & Ladders,
QRS week, etc.). I'd like to ask each of you to do the same,
on your local magazines, Clubs, web pages , etc..., to promote
the EuCW Club and to let other OM know we exist (hi). After that,
please send us a copy of your articles, possibly in English (or
a short summary in English): so we can publish them on our site,
at the end of the year.

2.2) EuCW special commission about the harmonization of the IARU
Regions band plan?

It's time to get more and more involved in the process of the
harmonization of the IARU Regions band - plan: why don't
we keep in touch about it by nominating a special commission to
study this process in order to suggest what do do and how to do in
formal meetings (IARU / ITU)? What about trying to push Ham Radio
National Clubs to ask to Governments to extend the ham radio bands
dedicated to the CW mode?

2.3) EuCW award.

We'd like to print a new EuCW award: are you an artist? Would
you be so kind to send us some ideas about the new lay - out?

2.4) EuCW (annual?) dinner?

We though: "why don't organize an annual (?) EuCW dinner somewhere
in Europe?". What do you think about it? It could be a nice way to
meet each others and talk about our activities, cw, projects, etc.

3) EuCW Activity: Snakes And Ladders.

As you know, the main goal of the "Snake & Ladders activity"
is to make friendly and relaxed QSOs: points are given to the
stations for each QSO and a bonus can be earned by working ladder
and snake squares; there are 2 runs of this activity, each with
six operating periods of a month. The "winter/spring" run starts
on January 1st and ends on June 30th. The "summer/autumn" run
starts on July 1st and ends on December 31st. QSOs must take at
least five minutes, stations must be all European: each OM may be
contacted once per day, irrespective of the band. This is not a
contest with short QSOs and a fixed format. On the contrary: the
"Snake & Ladders" activity promotes QSOs without any particular
format where QSO partners have real conversations over at least 5
minutes. Contacts made must be point-to-point. QSOs shall be made
in the dedicated CW sections of all amateur bands from 160m to 2m
(60m and 4m excluded), as follows: 160m: 1.828-1.838 MHz, 80m:
3.560-3.570 MHz, 40m: 7.030-7.040 MHz, 30m: 10.120-10.130 MHz, 20m:
14.060-14.070 MHz, 17m: 18.085-18.095 MHz, 15m: 21.060-21.070 MHz,
12m: 24.905-24.915 MHz, 10m: 28.060-28.070 MHz, 6m: 50.090-50.100
MHz, 2m: 144.100-144.110 MHz. We invite you to take part to the
"Snake & Ladders" activity; it is a good way to improve our cw
skills and our rag-chew capacity. I hope to read you soon with
your suggestions.

Best 73 es see you on the air,
