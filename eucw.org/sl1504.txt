Snakes & Ladders (v2) result for April 2015

Welcome back to this second edition of EuCW Snakes & Ladders. It is good to see
so many participants back. And a warm welcome to three new participants, DH3LK
Rudolf, OE6GWG Werner and OK2PXJ Vaclav!

Received were 30 logs, containing 1213 valid QSOs into 253 locator squares. A
good start of the new season, thanks to all for participating!

Among the 253 locator squares, we had 51 locator squares with more than 5 QSOs.
From these 51 locator squares, the following squares were randomly selected to
be the snakes for this month:

	IN96, IO71, IO93, JN49, KP10

Of the 253 square locators worked, 111 (!) made it to ladder square with only 1
QSO each:
IM58 IM78 IM79 IM99 IN72 IN81 IN82 IN83 IN87 IN91 IN92 IN97 IO51 IO52 IO53 IO62
IO73 IO76 IO84 JM75 JM76 JN01 JN09 JN13 JN23 JN24 JN26 JN27 JN28 JN38 JN52 JN61
JN66 JN69 JN70 JN71 JN72 JN78 JN80 JN85 JN94 JO29 JO57 JO63 JO68 JO71 JO72 JO73

To close this first report, some reactions from participants:

Lothar, DL1DXL, writes: I like the higher reward in the hot-bands and the 5
minute rule. Great also that the FISTS log converter was adapted for this.
MGR=> As to the FISTS log converter: all courtesy to Graham, G3ZOD, who has
again done a great job.

Michael, G0POT, writes: This activity and QRS week has encouraged me onto the
key more in the last month than in the last 4 years. Thoughroughly enjoying
improving my fist.
MGR=> Very glad to hear this (courtesy to Martin, IK2RMZ for QRS week!)

David, 2E0EML, writes: This month, I have been encouraged to try the HF bands.
Compared to 2M, HF has its challenges, but the rewards are greater. I now have
more CW QSOs logged than SSB. I just want to say Thank you to Peter G4LHI and
the gang in and around Huntingdon for getting me this far in a short space of
time.

Regards, best 73,
